The Community Forum</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">A community forum typically consists of a gathering of
    individuals who share a common concern. They come together to address that
    concern and discuss steps which may be taken to effectively address it. The National
    PTA (Parent Teachers Association) has a method for organizing a community
    forum which they call <i>10 Steps to Organizing a Community Forum&nbsp; </i>
    and it is a powerful tool for achieving
    its goal of guided, intelligent, effective community action.</p>
    <p align="left">A community forum has its own integrity as an activity in
    which the community may participate and as a means of potentially reducing
    gang activity and youth violence. It may also be viewed as a way to build a
    community-wide consensus that there is a need to address the gang (or any) situation
    and set the stage for a longer-term <a href="cooperation%20and%20coordination.htm">building
    of coalitions</a>.</p>

      <p align="left">Community forums educate, and an educated public may be
      more responsive to efforts to reduce gang activity and youth violence than
      an uneducated one. You'll probably find the media forthcoming in providing
      coverage for your event (since it's based on a controversial and timely
      topic - gangs and youth violence. Properly planned, the event can be
      a catalyst for needed change.</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">A Community Forum Success Story</font></b></p>
      <p align="left">I'd like to share a little story with you regarding
      community forums and what they can produce. As a result of my research on
      gangs, I have been asked to speak to many groups. One group asked me to
      speak at a community forum. The forum planners invited 250 community
      leaders and nearly 160 attended the meeting. That impressive showing was
      indicative of the concern the attendees had for the problem at hand. The
      group included representatives from affected neighborhood associations and
      from every social institution in the community (i.e., the local schools,
      faith institutions, mental health organizations, government office
      representatives, social agency directors, media personalities, business
      organizations, and politicians - city, county, state, and federal).</p>
      <p align="left">In preparation for the meeting I gathered data on: the
      number of juveniles referred to the county's juvenile services; the extent
      of child abuse; in-school assaults and suspensions; the number of alleged
      gang members on probation or parole in the county; and the number of
      juveniles coming to the local family violence center, substance abuse
      center, and victim center. I also provided a profile of gang activity and
      youth violence deduced from several interviews with local police and
      sheriffs.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">As a result of that meeting a group was formed which met
      for over a year as they went about creating a force in the community for
      drawing attention to the plight and needs of local youth. A &quot;grade
      card&quot; was also developed which provides an annual update on the
      statistics I had gathered and other data as well. I am told that the
      impact of that initial community forum can still be felt today.</p>
      <p align="left">A community-wide task force or council on gangs and youth
      violence also has a great deal of potential for reducing gang activity and
      youth violence
      and is our next topic.</p>
