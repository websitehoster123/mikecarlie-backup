    <p>In today's world of prevention and treatment of social problems the term <i>risk factor</i> refers to &quot;individual or environment hazards
    that increase an individual's vulnerability to negative developmental
    outcomes. A risk factor approach assumes that there are multiple, and often
    overlapping, risk factors in an individual's background that lead to adverse
    outcomes. Furthermore, it posits that it is the cumulation (sic) of risk in the
    life course that is most strongly related to adversity.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Thornberry2001">Thornberry</a>,
    2001, p. 32)</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In <i>Into the Abyss</i> we are dealing with risks related to becoming involved
    with a gang. Some of them are no different than the risks of getting
    involved in other socially inappropriate behavior. Examples of <i> risk factors</i> which may lead to gang
    involvement include non-attendance at school, school failure, substance abuse,
    being abused, unemployment, and living in a single-parent household or one
    which exhibits considerable dysfunctionality.</p>
    <p>Not all children exposed to risk factors become involved in youth
    violence or gangs due to the insulating effect of protective
    factors. <i>Protective factors</i> are conditions which
    shield a person from risk. What, in other words, are the
    factors which shield or protect a child from entering a gang? Reflecting on
    the risk factors identified above,&nbsp; they would include regular school attendance and academic success, remaining drug free,
    being gainfully or legally employed, and being raised in a loving, functional,
    non-abusive family setting.</p>
    <p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recently
    published their <i>1999 Pilot Training Manual</i> <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SAMHSA2000">2000</a>)</font>
    which included their list of risk- and protective factors. I have adapted
    their list - which uses the term &quot;problem behavior&quot; in a generic
    sense - to use the word &quot;gang.&quot;<a name="Factors"></a></p>

    <p>There are a multiplicity of risk and protective factors. Ideally,
    for each risk factor there is at least one protective factor. There are many
    communities in the United States that are continually assessing the risks to which their youth are exposed and determining if
    there are sufficient protective factors in place for each of the risks. Where missing,
    efforts to provide protective factors/programs are being implemented.</p>
    <p> Lisbeth Schorr noted that &quot;No one
    circumstance, no single event, is the cause of a rotten outcome ... But
    each risk factor vanquished does enhance the odds of averting later serious
    damage.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Schorr1989">Schorr and
    Schorr</a>, 1989)</font>&nbsp;
    In a similar vein, the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and
    Delinquency Prevention stated that:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Minimizing risk factors and maximizing
      protective factors throughout the developmental cycle from birth through
      adolescence can give all youth a better chance to lead productive,
      crime-free lives.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Early intervention programs and services for
      juveniles engaged in high-risk and minor delinquent behaviors are
      significantly reducing the number of juveniles penetrating the juvenile
      and criminal justice systems.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Many interventions geared toward
      serious and chronic juvenile offenders have had positive effects on
      subsequent reoffense rates. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Coordinating2000">Coordinating
      Council</a>, 2000, pp. 9 and 12)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As identified by Glick <font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Glick1992">1992</a>)</font>,
    at-risk youth entering a gang may have encountered racism, poverty, the lack
    of a support network, and media influences. Each of these were discussed in
    greater detail in <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm#top">Why
    Gangs Form</a>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b><font color="#0000FF">Racism:</font> When young people encounter both
      personal and institutional racism (i.e., systematic denial of privileges),
      the risks are increased. When groups of people are denied access to power,
      privileges, and resources, they will often form their own
      anti-establishment group.</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2"><b><font color="#0000FF">Poverty:</font> A sense of hopelessness can result
      from being unable to purchase wanted goods and services. Young people
      living in poverty may find it difficult to meet basic physical and
      psychological needs which can lead to a lack of self-worth and pride. One
      way to earn cash is to join a gang involved in the drug trade.</b></font>
      <p><font size="2"><b><font color="#0000FF">Lack of a support network:</font> Gang members often
      come from homes where they feel alienated or neglected. They may turn to
      gangs when their needs for love are not being met at home. Risks increase
      when the community fails to provide sufficient youth programs or
      alternatives to violence.</b></font>
      <p><b><font size="2"><font color="#0000FF">Media influences:</font> Television, movies, radio,
      and music all have profound effects on youth development. Before youth
      have established their own value systems and are able to make moral judgments, the media promotes drugs, sex, and violence as an acceptable
      lifestyle. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Glick1992">Glick</a>,
      1992, blue color added for emphasis)</font>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">C. Ronald Huff, a nationally recognized expert on gangs and 
	youth violence, tells us that</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>In addressing the problem of youth 
		violence, several important points must be noted. First, violent 
		behavior by youths is a complex phenomenon that results from multiple 
		factors. Therefore, it is important that we approach the problem of 
		youth violence from multiple perspectives and disciplines, because 
		violence stems from multiple sources of risk including neurobiological, 
		individual, family, neighborhood, ecological, and socio-economic 
		factors.</b></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Second, we must view violence as 
		occurring along a developmental continuum. Different points along this 
		continuum represent different opportunities for prevention or 
		intervention efforts. Longitudinal research suggests that there are at 
		least two different kinds of life-course trajectories leading to 
		violence - early onset (violence beginning prior to puberty) and late 
		onset (violence beginning after puberty, or around age 13). These two 
		life-course trajectories have very different implications for prevention 
		and intervention strategies, as noted in the U.S. Surgeon General's 
		(2001) report on youth violence. Youths who become violence before about 
		age 13 generally commit more crimes, and more serious crime, for a 
		longer period of time. Their violence tends to escalate throughout 
		childhood and sometimes continues into their adult years.</b></font></p>
		<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Third, an integrated, systematic, 
		longer-term approach that includes multiple disciplines and intercedes 
		at multiple levels is necessary if we are to have sustainable and 
		generalizable change. We will not effectively prevent or substantially 
		ameliorate youth violence if we depend on rigid approaches from any 
		single perspective. </font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Huff2004">Huff</a>,

    <p align="left">The risk factors identified by Glick and Howell are those which were
    identified in some of the most current research on gangs. Many of them are familiar as we have explored them earlier in <i>Into the Abyss</i>.
    Noticeably absent, however, are the impact of discrimination and community
    denial of a gang presence. A community which fails to address racial and
    ethnic discrimination or one which is in denial about discrimination will do little to
    correct the forces which may result in a youth's participation in gang
    activity.</p>
    <p align="left">While an even more extended list of risk factors could be
    made (i.e., Esbensen's <font size="1">[<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#EsbensenSeptember2000">2000</a>,
    <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/2000_9_2/page2.html">page</a>]</font>
    discussion of <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/2000_9_2/page2.html">risk-
    and protective factors and gang activity</a>), what
    is important to note is that <i> each risk factor needs a corresponding
    protective factor</i> in order to prevent the risk from leading to gang
    involvement. In the long run, putting protective factors in place will result
    in reduced gang activity and youth violence.&nbsp;Realistically, few communities or neighborhoods are going to be able to address
    all of the risks identified. But every community
    can choose to focus upon the risks it has identified as the most insidious and
    develop protective factors to cancel out their influence.</p>

    findings are a powerful endorsement of the protective factor approach.</p>

    <p><font size="2"><b>The children were well-liked by peers and adults,
    and they had well-developed social and interpersonal skills. They were
    reflective rather than impulsive about their behavior. They had a high
    sense of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and personal responsibility. They had
    an internal locus of control; i.e., they believed they were able to
    influence their environment in a positive manner. They demonstrated an
    ability to be flexible in their coping strategies. They had well-developed
    problem solving skills and intellectual abilities. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Werner1990">Werner</a>,

    <p>Werdmolder, in his study of gangs in the Netherlands, found sporting
    activities to be protective factor for at-risk youth. &quot;Generally, the importance of sports
    lies within the leisure time sphere, but for unemployed youngsters sports
    can also function as an alternative and meaningful pastime. Sports are
    not only a means to meet people, they also lend regularity and discipline to
    life. Foremost, sports may stimulate a feeling of self-respect.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Werdmolder1997">Werdmolder</a>,

    <p>The purpose of this Part of the <i>Into the Abyss</i> is to lay the
    foundation for the protective factors which will be discussed throughout much
    of the remainder of the book. What we'll turn to now is a look at some of
    the protective factors which may be provided by individual citizens, former
    gang members, and families.</p>
