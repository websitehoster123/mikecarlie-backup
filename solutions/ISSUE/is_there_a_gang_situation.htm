    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Are there <a name="gangs"> gangs</a> in your community?</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">One of the best initial strategies for reducing gang 
	activity in any community is to learn where it is taking place, who's 
	involved, what they are doing, why they're doing it, and what the 
	community's resources are that could be brought to bear upon the situation. 
	In most cases, gang activity will be confined to certain neighborhoods. If 
	you already know gangs are present, you need not read this Part any further. 
	If, on the other hand, you're not sure, please take a look at the National 
	Youth Gang Center's publication <em>
	<a href="http://www.iir.com/nygc/acgp/assessment.htm">A Guide to Assessing 
	Your Community’s Youth Gang Problem</a></em>.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Talk">Talk</a> With Those Who Know</font></b></p>
    <p>Other than personal exposure to gangs, the best source of
    information on whether a given neighborhood has gangs are local juvenile
    officers, probation/parole officers, and police. Due to the nature of their work they are &quot;in the
    know.&quot; In some communities, there are barriers between the public
    and local criminal justice practitioners, teachers, and others who could
    talk about the gang situation but are afraid to do so or have been
    instructed not to talk about them by their supervisors, local politicians,
    or influential business leaders, among others.</p>
    <p>Whether juvenile officer, probation/parole officers, or police tell you
    about the gangs may
    be a matter of office politics. They may have been told by their
    administrators that they are not to talk about the subject of
    &quot;gangs&quot; with the public. More often than not, if a good working relationship is established
    with the officers, they will be forthcoming. After all,
    they entered
    their line of work to help people and know that a community willing to
    address the gang situation will, in the long run, benefit everyone.</p>
    <p>Prosecutors, youth-serving agency personnel, school
    administrators, and others may also be forthcoming if the setting is right.
    Other than meeting with these people individually, a public mechanism for obtaining
    needed information is a community forum. We'll return to that topic a little
    later.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Look For <a name="Telltale"> Telltale</a> Signs</font></b></p>
    <p>One can also tell if gangs are present by the <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/graffiti_and_other_identifiers.htm#Graffiti">graffiti</a>
    they create. It can sometimes be found on the back of business buildings, in
    alleyways, on the back of street signs, on sidewalks, on large and small
    metal trash containers, and on utility-type poles. If the gang thinks it
    dominates an area, the graffiti may be more conspicuously placed such as on
    the front of a building at a major intersection or on the corner mailbox.
    There are as many places to post graffiti as there are flat surfaces.</p>
    <p>While most people don't know how to
    interpret graffiti, they can sense there's
    a difference between &quot;Bob loves Sue&quot; and <font face="EraserDust">Btk
    187</font>. What they may not know is that &quot;BTK&quot; is the tag
    (graffiti) for an Asian gang called <i> Born To Kill</i>
    and the number &quot;187&quot; refers to <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/187-199.html">California
    Penal Code 187: murder</a>. It is possible that a BTK member created that
    graffiti and is indicating the gang's intention to commit a murder or, if
    the BTK is crossed out, that
    someone from a rival gang
    is about to murder a member of the BTK.</p>

            found on nearly every building in the central part of the city and extends from ground level to nearly six feet up the buildings'
            walls. It has been accumulating in some areas for the past ten years

    <p>If the graffiti is unintelligible, residents
    should ask local juvenile officers, probation/parole officers, and police what it means.
    Maybe you noticed some graffiti on a child's school notebook, or some
    children are wearing - or avoiding wearing - a certain color of clothing.
    Perhaps you saw a child make a gesture with his or her fingers with which

    <p>While not every youth who exhibits the gang identifiers listed above is
    a gang member, seeing a youth who exhibits several of the
    identifiers should raise one's curiosity as to what's going on. If it's your
    child, talk to him or her first before you jump to any conclusions. Then
    talk with someone who can give you more information (i.e., a juvenile officer,
    probation/parole officer, police, your child's teacher).</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Where">Where</a> are the
    Gangs?</font></b></p>
    <p>If there is a gang in your community,
    where is it? If my experience in the field applies to your situation,
    you can pin point the </p>
	<p>(s) in your community in which gang
    members live. This information should be available from juvenile officers, probation/parole officers,
    and police. While you may not be given names and addresses, their general location may be revealed.</p>
    <p> By focusing on neighborhoods in which concentrations of gang youth live you
    can focus your solution efforts as well. That's a practical and cost
    effective way of approaching the problem. That's what police do when targeting gangs and gang
    members for surveillance or for sweeps. Why not use the same method in a treatment approach?&nbsp; Miller
    <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">2001</a>)</font>
    believes this is precisely what
    we need to do. His study of where gang members live (by city and county
    throughout the United States) allows us to focus on prevention,
    intervention, and suppression efforts where they are most needed by &quot;identifying the 'hotspots' of gang activity.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>
    , 2001, p. 4)</font></p>

    <p>Information on the whereabouts of gang members can also be deduced from
    conversations with schools administrators and a review of data on school
    suspensions for fighting. I say this because neighborhood schools having the most difficulty
    may have gang members living in their neighborhoods. The fights, therefore,
    are sometimes gang-related (i.e., settling disputes, carrying out
    initiations). The only exception to this rule would be if students are bused
    from one neighborhood to another in order to attend school. But there are
    still ways to trace in-school fighting incidents back to the neighborhoods
    in which the fighters live.</p>
    <p>Youth-serving
    community-based agency personnel and juvenile officers are also able to
    identify particular neighborhoods in a community from which they receive
    most of their problem-behavior clientele.</p>
    <p>Another way to determine if gangs may be present is through data on
    drug-related arrests. The drugs of concern are usually <a href="http://www.streetdrugs.org/methamphetamine.htm">methamphetamine</a>,
    <a href="http://www.streetdrugs.org/crack.htm">crack cocaine</a>, and <a href="http://www.streetdrugs.org/marijuana.htm">marijuana</a>.
    Not all gangs or gang members deal in drugs and those that do may be
    involved in other drugs as well. Your local police department assembles an annual report on persons arrested (which it then sends to the
    Federal Bureau of Investigation or Bureau of Justice Statistics). That
    report should reveal if drug sales are being conducted in your community as
    measured by drug-related arrests. In what neighborhoods are those arrests
    being made? Is that where the gang members live?</p>

    <p>Most people who live in public housing projects and high-turnover
    immigrant housing developments are decent, law-abiding people. These areas
    are also hotbeds of activity for gangs.
    If there are large public housing projects in your community you can determine
    if gangs are present by talking with the project manager or the
    patrol officers who work that beat. You could
    also take a drive around the vicinity and look for signs of
    possible gang activity (i.e., graffiti, groups of youths loitering during
    school hours, open-air drug sales).</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="What">What</a> are they doing?</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">We already know the kinds of <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/crimes_gangs_commit.htm">crimes
    gangs commit</a>. You need to know what kinds of crimes gang members in <b>your</b>
    neighborhood commit. Police patrol officer knows who the local
    gang members are and what they're doing. Perhaps it's time to get a few of
    the neighbors together and request a meeting with the patrol officer(s) in
    question.</p>
    <p align="left">You could help matters by keeping a record of criminal or
    suspicious activity taking place in your neighborhood. If enough
    neighbors do this, then present the information to the police, something positive
    may be done about the problem. It may be only a
    short-term solution (a few individuals are approached by the police and
    encouraged to cease and desist in their undesirable behaviors), but it may also lead to long-term solutions as a basis for conversation and action in a
    community forum or task force meeting.&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left">You may even form a Neighborhood Watch group. The
	<a href="http://www.nnwi.org/">National Neighborhood Watch Institute</a> 
	provides some valuable information on their homepage. The National Crime
    Prevention Council (NCPC) has a very informative web site which provides
    suggestions on
	<a href="http://www.ncpc.org/resources/files/pdf/neighborhood-safety/nwstart.pdf">how to organize a
    Neighborhood Watch program</a> and what it takes for such a program to be successful.</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Now">Now</a> what?</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">Once you've determined there is a gang presence in your
    neighborhood or community you can probably assume there are several reasons why
    the gangs formed. In the parlance of community-based social work, <i> the reasons
    for their formation are referred to as risk factors</i> and <i> the factors
    which inhibit a youth's attraction to gangs are called protective factors</i>.
    That is our next subject.</p>
