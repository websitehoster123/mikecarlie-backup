    <p>In terms of collaboration,
    the community and government are best served when the many levels of
    government collaborate with each other in the provision of services.
    Collaborative strategies include the sharing vital data, avoiding overlapping or duplicative services,
    collective targeting of
    problematic issues (such as the presence of gangs and youth violence), and
    unifying the assessment or evaluation of services government agencies
    provide. The following are related solutions.

    </p>
    <p>Various agencies within government, and certain government employees,
    possess valuable grant writing skills. The sharing of these skills with
    local youth-serving agencies is a significant and promising strategy. It should be emphasized that many agencies dealing with
    gangs and youth violence are struggling to
    maintain their current level of service. They need and
    want to expand but in a resource-poor environment this can
    not be done effectively. Increases in funding, including grants, are
    badly needed as are the skills of government employed grant writers.
    </p>
    <p>Government offices are also a potential source of limited funding and are familiar
    with other sources of funding of interest to youth-serving agencies.

    Legislation</font></b>
    </p>
    <p>Legislators are of vital importance. Their
    foresight and concern can result in the creation or modification of procedures
    and laws which have the potential of reducing gang activity and youth violence.
    Related strategies include keeping area legislators
    and judges attuned to local gang and youth violence activity and concerns and what the community
    residents and local government agencies and organizations believe would be an appropriate
    response from the law makers.
    </p>
    <p>Becoming familiar with what other jurisdictions are doing <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/legislature.htm"> legislatively</a> in
    regards to youth violence and gangs is another meaningful strategy. Among the newer strategies are the use of boot camps coupled with
    education and vocational training programs, shock incarceration (usually a
    term of 120 days in prison, often spent in substance abuse treatment), enhanced
    penalties for individuals convicted of gang-related crimes, teen courts, and
    the use of drug courts. Needless to say, making all youth aware of the
    legal consequences of unacceptable behavior is a helpful strategy. The
    following are other legislative solutions.
