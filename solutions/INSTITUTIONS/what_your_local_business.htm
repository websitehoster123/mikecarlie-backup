    <p>One of the engines that drives a community is its economy. Without
a healthy economy, families cannot support themselves, faith institutions and
their outreach programs cannot be created, schools cannot be built nor teachers
hired, and no infrastructure can be constructed or meaningfully maintained
(i.e., parks, streets, water systems, sidewalks, electrical power).</p>
    <p>The business community consists of both private businesses and the
    various organizations to which some business owners and employees belong
    (i.e., the local Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and Kiwanis). Local businesses hold one of the numbers to the combination which unlocks
    and nourishes a community's future. The other social institutions hold the other
    numbers to the combination. Without a proper upbringing (family and faith), sufficient
    knowledge (schools), and a job (the business sector), a child has little
    hope of succeeding. <b>Businesses play a vital role in providing an
    incentive to work, job training, job opportunities, and advancement</b> for
    everyone in the community.</p>
    <p>The primary obligation and purpose of any business is to make a profit
    for its owners, shareholders (if any), and employees. Businesses must also
    give back to the community - to help strengthen and improve it. By doing so,
    they are assured of their future existence, continued profits, and enhance
    their image in the eyes of the public they serve. In this sense, <b>businesses
    are a community partner and responsible for participating in efforts to
    address community issues.</b> <a href="#Wang">As Wang found</a>, businesses
    have a vested interest in reducing gang activity and youth violence.</p>
    <p>The following are some of the ways in which individual businesses and
    business organizations do or could participate in helping reduce gang
    activity and youth violence. Many of them are tax deductible if the agencies
    they support qualify. The solutions have been divided into two categories: <a href="#Workplace">
    workplace-based</a> solutions and <a href="#Community"> community-based</a> solutions.</p>

            me rehearse at his funeral parlor. He would sit on one side of the
            room, and I would practice my speech on the other side — with the

            being able to communicate effectively. But far more importantly, he
