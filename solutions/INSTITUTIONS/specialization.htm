    <p>Reducing gang activity is not an easy task. It may be easier in a
    gang-emergent community than in a chronic gang community, but it is still
    difficult to achieve. One of the most difficult aspects of reducing gang
    activity in a given community is coordinating the activities of its various
    youth-serving agencies and social institutions. Each one is an entity unto
    itself, often at odds with or distant from the efforts of others.</p>
    <p>Agencies are competing for the same dollars with too few staff and, in
    most cases, an overwhelming number of clients to assist. To ask them to take
    time away from their work to collaborate and coordinate their services with
    other agencies and social institutions is sometimes too much to ask.
    This resistance to cooperation and coordination simply needs to be overcome in
    order to achieve a genuine and long-lasting reduction in gang activity and youth violence.</p>
    <p>In what follows we'll take a closer look at vertical specialization,
    community-wide involvement, a blueprint for successful collaboration, and
    conclude with a word of advice.</p>

    <p>By <i>radiating</i> <i>specialization</i> I refer to the need to have at
    least one contact person at home, at school, in the police department, in
    the prosecutor's office, in court, at juvenile services, and in adult
    probation and parole who know about the gang situation. Ideally, this
    radiating circle of people who know about gangs culminates in the creation
    of a community-wide task force on gangs and youth violence allowing the
    entire community to focus on youth issues and their solution.</p>
    <p>It is a circle of specialists and concerned citizens which radiates out 
    from the home, continues through the social institutions of informal control 
    (i.e., schools, the faith community, the business community, etc.), the 
    social institutions of formal control (i.e., police, courts, corrections) and ends in the
    community. What follows is a brief description of the role each element in
    the radiating circle of concern plays and the rationale for each.</p>

      that women bring more than employment needs into the welfare office, that

    promising developments in this arena. What follows are some examples of ways

    <p>As you can perhaps tell, by the time a neighborhood's gang situation
    becomes serious, the solutions needed to resolve it become progressive more
    difficult to implement. It can be done - other communities have been
    successful in reducing gang activity and youth violence through
    community-wide comprehensive approaches - but it requires a great deal of work. What follows
    are some guidelines for creating a successful collaboration between local
    youth-serving agencies and a community's social institutions.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">A <a name="Blueprint"> Blueprint</a> for Successful
Collaboration</font></b></p>
    <p>A community-wide task force on gangs is a coalition and its power is
    greatly enhanced when the members of it collaborate in their efforts to
    reduce gang activity and youth violence. To explore these topics together
    please review <a href="../NEIGHBORHOOD/task_force.htm#community">what a
    community-wide task force on gangs is</a> then explore a blueprint of <a href="../NEIGHBORHOOD/cooperation%20and%20coordination.htm#Steps">how
    it might work collaboratively</a> by exploring those parts of <i>Into the
    Abyss</i>.

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">It takes a considerable amount of time
      for communities to develop viable collaborations. These are complex
      mechanisms that involve organizations with different institutional
      climates and levels of autonomy, flexibility, and power; individuals with
      differing levels of experience and expertise; and diverse cultural
      contexts that give rise to different ways of defining issues and
      solutions.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Organizations need to develop the trust
      necessary to agree on how to work together and to decide what to do. Once
      established, collaborative relationships need to be nurtured and
      maintained over time. Consequently, collaboration is not easy and takes
      much time and effort. Organizations must work to overcome histories that
      include turf issues, longstanding isolation, dissension and mistrust among
      key parties, and real shortages of resources.</font><font size="1"> </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Morleyetal2000">Morley,

    solutions. What follows is a list of other programs which have been shown to
    reduce gang activity and youth violence and links to other materials related to
