<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A juvenile gang member's first appearance in court is often a pivotal event
    because he or she will cause a &quot;record&quot; of their appearance to be created.
    That record will then follow the juvenile until he or she becomes an adult. In some states, juvenile records are sealed when
    juveniles become adults - their record
    can not be opened or used against them should they reoffend and appear in criminal (adult) court.
    Adults' records, on the other hand, are not sealed.</p>
    <p>The trip to court is pivotal for adults and juveniles alike because, in
    addition to creating a &quot;record&quot; on the individual which may be
    used in future proceedings, the
    court determines, through its sentencing decisions, whether offenders are to
    be <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Incarceration">incarcerated</a>, sentenced to treatment in the
    community, or given some alternative sentence. For juveniles, a trip to juvenile court is likely to result in a
    sentence to <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Probation">probation</a>
    if the court determines the juvenile violated a law. For adult gang members
    (16, 17, or 18 years of age or older depending upon the state's definition
    of an adult), a trip to court may mean a variety of things.</p>
    <p>Criminal courts can sentence an offender to a
    period of incarceration or impose an alternative, community-based sentence.
    Given what most prosecutors and judges know about the impact of
    incarcerating offenders, sentences to incarceration are considered a last
    resort. Rather than deterring offenders from future offending, periods of
    incarceration may exacerbate the situation.</p>
    <p>While incarcerated, inmates are exposed to the brutality of life in
    confinement (as victims of abuse by other inmates and prison staff) and
    suffer from discrimination in employment and housing when returned to the
    community. Unless gang offenders have committed particularly heinous offenses, prosecutors and judges
    often prefer to impose an alternative to
    incarceration if it has any promise of effectively modifying the offender's behavior.
    The next topic in <i>Into the Abyss</i> is alternative sentencing. This
    section, however, focuses on what
    prosecutors and judges could do to reduce gang activity and youth violence
    other than use alternative sentencing. It also explores what they could do to reduce
    witness and victim intimidation by gangs.</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Witness and Victim <a name="Intimidation"> Intimidation</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Regardless of what prosecutors and judges may do in court, if
    witnesses to gang-related crimes and the victims of them refuse to appear in
    court, most cases will be dismissed. The problem, of course, has to
    do with gang member intimidation of witnesses and victims of their
    criminal activity. I would guess that nearly every prosecutor in the
    United States has had to face problems related to intimidation. By reading <i><a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/pdffiles/163067.pdf">Preventing
    Gang and Drug-Related Witness Intimidation</a></i> prosecutors may find a
    way to protect them.
    <p>The Prosecuting Attorneys Office in San Francisco (CA) has a 
	<a href="http://www.sfdistrictattorney.org/page.asp?id=51">Gang Violence Unit</a> designed to target the problem of
    violence by gang members. The greatest difficulty they face is getting
    witnesses to testify.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">The biggest challenge facing prosecutors in gang cases is to secure
    the cooperation of witnesses. Since most gang violence is &quot;gang on
    gang,&quot; the witnesses to drive-by shootings or gang fights tend to be
    gang members themselves. Members of the victim gang often feel that they
    will &quot;take it out on the street,&quot; and decline to help the police
    or D.A. because it is seen as &quot;snitching.&quot;</font></b><font size="2">
	</font> 
    <p><b><font size="2">Members of the perpetrator gang themselves often face potential criminal
    liability, and would rather go to jail themselves that &quot;rat&quot; on a
    fellow gang member. Witnesses and victims who are themselves not affiliated
    with any gangs tend to fear retaliation if they cooperate, particularly if
    they live in the gang's neighborhood.</font></b><font size="2"> </font> </p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Many witnesses distrust governmental authority, either because of
    questionable immigration status, or because they have recently immigrated
    from countries where government agents are feared.</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Members of the Gang Violence Unit are trained in dealing with these
    issues, and in effectively working with recalcitrant witnesses in order to
    be able to present the cases in court. </b></font><font size="1">(The Gang Violence Unit,

      <font size="2"><b>Police administrators and county attorneys can reduce [barriers to relocating witnesses] significantly by increasing the funding

      <p><b><font size="2">Although preventing intimidation in the courtroom and
      in jails and prisons may appear to be beyond the control of prosecutors
      and police investigators, there are a variety of ways in which they can

      security of witnesses who will testify if they feel they can be protected
      against retaliation. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FinnHealey1996">Finn

      <p><b><font size="2">Community-wide witness intimidation is one of the
      most frustrating and seemingly intractable problems for police and
      prosecutors. However, some jurisdictions report that community outreach
      efforts, especially community-based policing and prosecution, can improve
      relations between citizens and the criminal justice system and thereby
      increase witness cooperation. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FinnHealey1996">Finn

    <p align="left">Prosecutors and judges will use community-based alternatives
    to incarceration only when they are available. Without such programs,
    there is little they can do other than put offenders on probation or
    sentence them to a period of incarceration. Our next topic is the
    identification and description of several different alternative sentences.</p>
