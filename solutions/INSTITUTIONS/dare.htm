    <p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">What I Learned About:&nbsp;<br>
    D.A.R.E.<br>
    </font><font size="2" color="#0000FF">Drug Awareness and Resistance
    Education</font></b></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b>What is D.A.R.E.?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
    <p>&quot;The D.A.R.E. program has three main goals. First, (it) seeks to
    provide students with a knowledge base on the effects of drug abuse that go
    beyond the physical ramifications and extend to emotional, social, and
    economic aspects of life. Secondly, (it) aims to build decision-making and
    problem solving skills and strategies to help students make informed
    decisions and resist drug use, peer pressure, and violence. Lastly, an
    integral part of the ... program is to provide students with alternatives to
    drug use.</p>
    <p>D.A.R.E. is a universal program designed to reach the general population,
    rather than &quot;at risk&quot; groups, and it is most often implemented in
    the fifth and sixth grades. Research has shown this to be a time when
    children are very receptive to anti-drug messages, particularly as they
    approach the age associated with drug experimentation. The curriculum
    focuses on knowledge and skill development in seven areas:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1) cognitive information,&nbsp;<br>
        2) recognizing pressures,&nbsp;<br>
        3) refusal skills,<br>
        4) consequential thinking and risk taking,<br>
        5) interpersonal and communication skills,&nbsp;<br>
        6) decision making,&nbsp;<br>
        7) positive alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Some of the D.A.R.E. lessons focus on raising awareness in these skill
    areas, while others emphasize their practical application.&quot; (<a href="http://www.dare.com/common/overview.htm">Source</a>:
    The D.A.R.E. Internet Site)</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Why D.A.R.E. and Gangs?</b></font></p>
    <p>Why discuss a drug resistance education program in a book on gangs?&nbsp;
    There are several reasons.&nbsp; Like the G.R.E.A.T. program, D.A.R.E. works
    to help kids feel better about themselves, teaches them ways to manage
    conflict without resorting to violence, and helps them deal with the
    stresses and strains of life growing up as a little kid.&nbsp;&nbsp; These
    skills are needed to not only resist drugs, they are needed to resist gangs
    we well.</p>
    <p>I have often been asked if it isn't duplicative to have a G.R.E.A.T.
    program in the school if there's already a D.A.R.E. program, or <i>visa
    versa</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; My reply is always the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have
    you seen any of the childrens' problems over solved?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    vote for caution and, if a duplicity of programs helps, do it.&nbsp;
    Besides, the D.A.R.E. programs do not emphasize the reality of gangs in the
    training whereas that is the primary focus of the G.R.E.A.T. program.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Ken Dail's Remarks</font></b></p>
    <p>I am a member of a chat-room group which consists of professional people
    who have a special interest in understanding a reducing gang activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The following is from an email sent to the group by Ken
    Dail from Michigan, one of the group members.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it sums up
    what he sees as the value of a <a href="http://www.dare-america.com/index_3.htm">D.A.R.E.</a>
    program.&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman" size="6"></o:p>

youth turn around they see a positive message and see a grown up caring and

a Budweiser ad, and a Philly Blunt ball cap, and a movie about the good guy
killing all the bad guys, and their parents and other adults bombed out of their
minds, or whatever, then D.A.R.E. doesn't have a prayer.</b></font></p>
