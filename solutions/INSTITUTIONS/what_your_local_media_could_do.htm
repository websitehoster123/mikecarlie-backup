    <p align="left">Most of what Americans know about gangs is acquired through
    the mass media, not through personal experience, significant others, or
    other social groups or institutions (except for children attending public
    schools). Most of us learn about gangs by
    listening to reports of gang activity presented by news anchors and
    commentators on radio and television and by reading journalists' accounts in
    newspapers and magazines. To be sure, there are millions of Americans living
    and working in known gang neighborhoods who know about gang first hand, but most
    Americans don't live or work in those neighborhoods.</p>
    <p align="left">The responsibility for informing America about gang activity
    and youth violence falls upon the mass media as the most efficient,
    affordable, and likely distributor of information currently available. <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/media.htm">We've
    already found</a> that what the media presents may not always be accurate. 
    The way in which the media portrays gangs and youth violence is sometimes 
    sensationalistic and, when it is, impedes a genuine understanding of these 
    issues. Sensationalized media reports may paralyze community members and 
    contribute to a climate of fear,
    panic, or denial. On the other hand, gang activity and youth violence do
    appear to be increasing and are a genuine concern to millions of people,
    many of them victims.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>While bullies, gangs, weapons, and
      substance abuse all contribute to the fear experienced by many of today's

      fear and apprehension about violence among children and adults, often
      fueled by the media, violence in America is a legitimate concern for
      everyone. Likewise, research and statistics regarding juvenile
      victimization cannot be entirely discounted as mere media sensationalism. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#ArnetteWalsleben1998">Arnette

    Paralyzing listeners, readers, and viewers with horror stories about gang
    initiations, gang fights, and gangland murders won't reduce their
    occurrence. It may sell newspapers, but it doesn't solve
    problems. A responsible press and responsible broadcast
    journalism are powerful tools for bringing about change in a community by providing accurate and
    useful information and by acting as a catalyst for those changes. &nbsp;</p>

              campaigns for youth-related products make this a potentially
              profitable experience for the media and a rewarding
              experience for the community as it takes one week out of each year
              to focus attention on local youth.<br>

              The media could support neighborhood activities with on-site broadcasts, neighborhood
    reports and updates, and specials on positive neighborhood developments. It
              could offer and publicize awards or honors for neighborhoods and residents

    <p align="left">If local media businesses are not taking the steps necessary to reduce gang
    activity and youth violence then perhaps they should be encouraged to do
    so. Letters to and meetings with editors and station owners alert them to
    the public's interest in these issues and may result in a change in programming. Holding a well-publicized <a href="../NEIGHBORHOOD/forum.htm">community
    forum</a> will also draw attention to the issues and may result in valuable
    coverage in the media.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">In Closing</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">The media play a critically important role in educating the 
    community. If they are misinforming or only partially informing the public 
    they serve regarding gang activity and youth violence, then the media has 
    become a part of the problem. There are many steps the media could take to 
    help reduce gang activity and youth violence in the communities they
    serve.</p>
    <p align="left">This concludes our review of media solutions and of solutions which
    could be generated by private and public social institutions. Even though we may be able to involve the public and private sectors in
    reducing gang activity and youth violence, if their efforts are uncoordinated they
    may be less effective than if were they orchestrated in some way. That's our
    next topic.&nbsp;</p>
