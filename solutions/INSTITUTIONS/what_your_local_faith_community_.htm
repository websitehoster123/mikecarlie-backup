    <p>A faith institution - through its leaders and programs - supports and
    instills into its congregants the morals, values, and ethics for which the
    faith stands. They define that which
    is <i>right</i> and that which is <i>wrong</i> and, in that context,
    violence is discouraged. For this reason, a community's faith institutions can make a significant contribution to
    reducing gang activity and youth violence. While not all members of a
    community may belong to one or another of these institutions, those who do
    have much to accomplish in this regard.<br>
    <br>
    A faith community (consisting of all faith institutions in the city or
    neighborhood) which is united and willing to work collaboratively can bring
    determination as well as spiritual, physical, and financial resources to an entire community's effort to reduce
    gang activity and youth violence.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><b><font size="2" color="#008000">The most promising
      gang initiatives are those which strategically engage the talents of the
      full spectrum of community including youth and adult residents, educators,

      concert with the more traditional juvenile justice components of police,

    institutions have promising strategies to offer from sermons designed to
    increase harmony, discourage the use of violence, and promote the value of diversity, to
    workshops for members on parenting skills, anger management, and non-violent
    conflict resolution. What a congregation and its leaders offer is limited
    only by their collective imagination and the needs of the people they
    serve.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In most of the communities I visited over the past several years the
    business community was only peripherally involved in efforts to reduce gang
    activity and youth violence. Considering how important the business sector is,
    and what it has to offer at-risk youth (job training, jobs, hope, and a
    future), it should be more involved in reducing gang activity and youth
    violence. Our next topic addresses what the business community could do to
    help reduce gang activity and youth violence.</p>
