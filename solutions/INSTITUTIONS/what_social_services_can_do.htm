    When the prevention and intervention efforts of the

            more social and educational activities, exhibited less antisocial
            behavior, committed fewer violent crimes, and used and sold fewer
            drugs in the year after the program ended.</font></b></p>
            <p align="left"><b><font size="2">CAR treatment methods included:
            tutoring; mentoring; treatment for drug and alcohol abuse; parenting

            <p align="left"><b><font size="2">One year after the program ended,
            CAR youths had more positive peer support than youths in the control
            group, associated less often with delinquent peers than youths in
            the control group, felt less peer pressure to engage in delinquent
            behaviors than youths in the control group, and were less frequently
            urged by peers to behave in antisocial ways than youths in the
            control group.</font></b></p>
            <p align="left"><b><font size="2">The average CAR program, when
            operating at full strength, served 90 participants and a similar
            number of family members (83) per year at a cost of $420,000. This
            amounts to slightly less than $4,700 a year per youth participant.
            When family members are included, the cost per individual served
            falls to $2,400. As programs gain experience, these costs may be
            reduced. </font></b></p>

        certain-to-be-repeated jail or prison term (about $15,000 to $40,000).

        then it's even more cost effective. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Harrelletal1999">Harrell,

Prevention for a period of only five years. I visited two of the Safe
Futures programs. Safe
Futures describes itself as:</b></font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2"><b>&quot;A federally-funded [program] aimed at reducing youth
  violence and delinquency, and focused on strengthening families. Safe
  Futures provides prevention, intervention and treatment services to high risk
  and delinquent youth and their families. It links them to a variety of
  free, comprehensive services within the ... community.&quot; </b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SafeFuturesStLouis">Safe
  Futures: City of St. Louis</a>, 1998)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>&quot;Among the offerings of the Safe Futures programs are mentoring, tutoring and
G.E.D. classes, job training and placement, recreation, counseling, cultural
enrichment, parenting skills classes, after school programs, crisis
intervention, home visits, parent education, leadership development, restitution
(whereby clients pay their victims for the harm they inflicted upon them),
community service, language assistance (for those who only speak a language
other than English), intensive after-care for youthful offenders, and gang
suppression. While some clientele are not in gangs, a significant
proportion of them are or are at-risk of joining a gang. According to the
Seattle Safe Futures director, &quot;The community planning
  board approved a special emphasis on immigrant and refugee youth and their
  families with an initial focus on Vietnamese and Cambodian communities, and
  girls at risk of delinquent or criminal behavior who are involved or are at
  risk of being involved in gang activity.&quot; </b> <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SeattleSafeFuturesFS">Seattle
  Safe Futures Fact Sheet</a>, 1009)</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>In addition, the Safe Futures effort attempts to build coalitions throughout
the community in hopes of bringing together the major social institutions (i.e.,
family, faith, schools, justice system and government, business, health care) in
collectively addressing the issues of gangs and delinquency.</b></font></p>
