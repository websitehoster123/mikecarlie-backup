    <p>The justice system in the United States is a vast,
    complex, and a last resort for dealing with all kinds of offenders - gang
    members included. By the time offenders come to the attention of the justice
    system they have failed to respond meaningfully to the informal controls
    supposedly imposed by family, school, faith, and neighborhood. By
    &quot;justice system&quot; I refer to both the juvenile justice system and
    the criminal (adult) justice system.</p>

    <p>As Blakemore and Blakemore <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Blakemore1998">1998</a>)
    </font>stated above, the justice system alone will not
    solve the gang situation. Such an effort is a collective affair including
    various social institutions. Other chapters in this section of <i>Into the
    Abyss </i>address what those
    social institutions could do to reduce gang activity and youth violence. This section, however, is dedicated to what the various
    components of the justice system could do.</p>

    <p>The following review of justice system solutions includes those associated with
    law, law enforcement (police), the courts, and both institutional- and
    community-based corrections - the four primary components of the justice system.</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Problematic">Problematic</a> Themes</font></b></p>

    <p>Before beginning that review, I'd like to point to several problems which
    run through the various components of the justice system like a common
    thread. Among the most noticeable to me are a failure to specialize
    sufficiently in addressing the gang situation, the inaccessibility of juvenile
    records to police and the criminal (adult) courts, and a lack of coordination
    and communication between the juvenile- and adult justice systems
    and their various components (police, courts, and corrections).</p>

    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Lack">Lack</a> of Specialization</font></b></p>

    <p>While some emerging- and chronic gang communities have gang-specialized units in all the components of their justice system, many do not. This lack of a meaningful organizational structure
    around the gang phenomenon is problematic. Gangs are a special phenomenon, and a
    dangerous one which can not be overlooked.&nbsp;They deserve and require
    special attention in law enforcement, the courts, and in corrections.</p>

    <p>By being specialized I refer to having laws put in place especially
    designed to
    curtail <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/legislature.htm#Creation">gang-related
    activity</a>, police departments with gang units, specially
    trained juvenile- and adult probation and parole officers with gang member caseloads,
    prosecutors' offices with one or more gang-designated prosecutors, and judges who
    specialize in gang-related cases. I believe we better serve the community
    and gang-related offenders if we specialize. Specialization allows
    the justice system to respond to gang activity more intelligently and
    effectively.</p>

    <b><font color="#0000FF">The <a name="Inaccessibility">Inaccessibility</a>
    of Juvenile Records</font></b></p>
    <p>Some of the juvenile justice offices I visited gathered useful and thorough
    information on their clients. Others did not. Some shared information on
    their clients with local police, but most did not and could not according to
    state laws which require juvenile records be kept private (for the eyes of
    juvenile court personnel only).</p>
    <p>In communities in which juvenile records were private, an
    officer confronted with a 19 year old male gang member could learn nothing
    from the official record about that young man's juvenile offenses, if any.
    Was he detained by police as a juvenile? Has he been actively involved in
    gang activity for the past ten years or just for the last two? Who were his
    associates in the gang when he was a juvenile? Unless the officer in question knew about the young
    man's past (or knew other officers who did), the information was
    unavailable.</p>
    <p>In those communities judges, too, were operating in the blind when it came
    time to sentence such offenders. Since the juvenile record was closed, it
    was difficult to determine if the sentence imposed was appropriate given the
    offender's past record. With no record accessible, how would the judge or
    the community know?</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Lack of Coordination and <a name="Communication"> Communication</a></font></b></p>
    <p>In most of the communities I visited there was little collaboration between legislators, police,
    prosecutors and judges, juvenile- and probation/parole officers, and the
    folks who ran correctional facilities (i.e., detention centers, jails,
    farms, camps, correctional schools,
    prisons). Communication and cooperation between the components of the
    justice system were the exception, not the rule.</p>
    <p>Evidence of some of the difficulties <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/difficulties.htm">police</a>
    and <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/PP/difficulties.htm">probation/parole
    officers</a> have in regards to other elements in the justice system were
    documented earlier.</p>

    <p align="center">
    <b><font color="#800000"><a name="Effective">Effective</a> Strategies</font></b></p>
    <p>In order to be effective, efforts to reduce gang activity and youth
    violence must begin with a coordinated policy of prevention, intervention, suppression
    and treatment backed up with the resources needed to make each approach effective.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    Prevention refers to education and other efforts which prevent children
    from entering gangs. Intervention is used with known or suspected gang
    members (regardless of their degree of affiliation) as a means of bringing
    them out of a gang. Suppression efforts translate into arrest and the removal of the offending gang
    member from the community. </p>
	<p>
    When suppression is used, intervention and/or treatment should
    be offered following conviction. Since over 90% of all imprisoned people in 
	the United States are eventually released from prison (discharged or on 
	parole), what's the use of it all if we don't treatment them (or at least 
	offer treatment) while they are incarcerated?</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Specialization">Specialization</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Among the most effective strategies today are those which find practitioners
    in the justice system aligned with each other in a shared and clearly
    articulated approach to reducing gang activity and youth violence. When one
    thinks of the justice process, it begins with the creation of laws. Then the
    police enforce them, prosecutors try them in court, and the corrections
    system is sent those who are convicted for appropriate treatment or
    punishment.</p>
    <p>In similar order, gang behavior is least likely to persist when: laws restricting or
    forbidding them are clear and well publicized; when police adopt a <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Zero">zero-tolerance</a> policy; when
    vertical prosecution is used, no plea bargains are struck, hard core offenders are
    convicted, and appropriate sentences are imposed (alternative sentences or sentences to
    jail or prison); and when proven prevention and intervention services are
    offered.</p>
    <p>Sentencing is of paramount importance in the justice process. Effective sentencing
    strategies related to gang activity and youth violence include swift and certain
    action by police and the courts at the <b> first</b> sign of such behavior
    (at the earliest age possible), resulting
    either in treatment of those who wish to and can be treated or removal from
    the community of those who will not or can not be treated.</p>
    <p>Both treatment and confinement require resources. Treatment requires a variety of community-based
    services sufficient to meet the needs of
    those who wish to be treated. At present there are too
    few services available given the number of youths involved in gang-related
    and violent
    behavior in communities across the nation.</p>
    <p>For confinement, we need humane, non-violent, and secure facilities within
    close proximity of offenders' homes so some degree of
    integration of the offender with family members and others outside the
    facility can be maintained. Unfortunately, our jails and
    prisons often fall short of meeting these very basic criteria. Violence, and the threat of it, are the stuff of everyday life in confinement,
    whether it be in a federal or state prison, a jail, or a juvenile detention
    center, camp, farm, or correctional school. The treatment of juveniles in detention may be a little better but
    it, too, could use improvement.</p>
    <p>But a well-tuned justice system should be our last resort. Success in
    reducing gang activity and youth violence depends upon: a heightened state of
    public awareness; parental, neighborhood, and community involvement; the availability of
    effective prevention and intervention strategies; and a well-tuned justice
    system.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Information">Information</a>-Sharing</font></b></p>
    <p>Another effective strategy is information-sharing between juvenile- and adult
    justice system practitioners which recognizes no limits on one's access to
    offenders' records, regardless of the age at which their offenses were
    committed. One hand must know what the other is doing.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Coordination">Coordination</a></font></b></p>
    <p>The
    last part of this chapter deals with promising strategies related to
    specialization, community-wide involvement, and coordination of services. That said, let's take a look at what legislators could do to help reduce
    gang activity and youth violence.</p>
