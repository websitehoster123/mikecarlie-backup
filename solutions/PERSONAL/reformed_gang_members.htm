    <p>Midway through my field research I encountered a South Los Angeles gang
    member who wanted to get out of the gang life. His name was Jose and you read about
    him <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/story.htm">previously</a>. About
    six months later I was in another community talking with juvenile officers
    whose community was experiencing an increase in gang activity. The juvenile
    detention center was filled with young gang members and the officers
    weren't sure how to proceed.

    <p>At one of the juvenile officer's suggestions, I invited Jose to visit 
	with the youth in the detention center and brought him to town for that 
	purpose. He spoke with the juvenile gang bangers for about an hour. The impact of his words were
    palpable. They had never met a sophisticated and
    dangerous gangster and they were actually frightened.</p>
    <p>I don't know what will become of those juvenile gang members in the long-term, but, 
	a few months later, the juvenile
    officers
    told me some of them were offending less often or had gotten out of the gang
    life all together. Will this work every time? I don't know. Does it have the
    potential of being a valuable tool in the tool chest of solutions? I have no
    doubt about that.</p>
    <p>Former gang members are an asset as part of a prevention and intervention
    strategy when they speak with gang- and non-gang youth (i.e., in a faith institution youth group,
    in school auditorium presentations, at camp, a the detention center and jail).
    In the Netherlands, Werdmolder <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Werdmolder1997">1997</a>)
    </font>found ex-drug users and ex-gang-members valuable as instructors.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Deploying ex drug users as &quot;instructors&quot; in working with substance abusers is a very effective
    treatment strategy. The same logic applies in working with gang
    members. </b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Werdmolder1997">Werdmolder</a>,
    1997, p. 91)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In addition to speaking with other youth, former gang members can
    participate in special television broadcasts (your local public television
    station may be interested in doing this), or radio program. In order to
    maximize their contribution, you could videotape a former gang member's
    presentation and use it with probationers, school children, and youths under
    the supervision of juvenile services. Be sure to get a signed release from
    the former gang member allowing you to make, distribute, and show the video
    at your discretion.</p>
    <p>Former gang members may be found by contacting local probation and parole officers. They know who their successful
    gang clients are and may be
    willing to attend presentations with them. The presentations are, in effect,
    part of the treatment program for the officers' clients. The following is an account of a former gang member's work with at-risk
    youth and active gang members in Springfield, Illinois, as published by the
    News Bureau, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#UIUC1996">1996</a>)</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Springfield, Ill. - Former Chicago gang
      member Efrain Marquez still is involved in the lifestyle he once left.
      However, instead of living life fast on the streets, he now actively helps
      young people in Springfield escape the dangers of gang activity.<br>
      <br>
      Through his voluntary involvement in violence-prevention programs of the
      University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service (CES), Marquez talks
      with gang members about how they can get involved in their community and
      get help from various agencies and organizations.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>With initial support of CES, he also
      established &quot;Faith, Hope and Love,&quot; a youth-resource group that
      provides outreach and group activities to at-risk youths in gang-prone
      areas. Such projects are examples of
		<a href="http://www.oc.uiuc.edu/engagement/index.html">Public Engagement</a>, the university's program of service to the state.<br>
      <br>
      Marquez, a 41-year-old truck driver for the city of Springfield, is an
      example of someone becoming involved in an important activity to help his
      community, said Dan Dawson, prevention educator for CES in Springfield.<br>
      <br>
      Living in Chicago, where the FBI estimates there are as many as 125
      different street gangs with up to 75,000 members, Marquez recalled,
      &quot;Gang life was a lifestyle you just kind of grew up into. As I was
      growing up, I was seeing how easy it is to fall into it, but it really
      doesn't lead anywhere but to drugs, alcohol and a fast life of pursuing
      money.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Outside help lured Marquez into a safer lifestyle in Chicago, where he
      began working with gang members to clean up graffiti. &quot;Through the
      Cooperative Extension people, we all began to see that there was a need to
      bring down graffiti around Springfield,&quot; Marquez said. &quot;So I got
      involved with the CES Paint the Town program [chaired by Dawson]. That led
      to more direct contact with teen-agers, especially with gang
      members.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Having direct contact with gangs is not for everybody,&quot; Marquez
      said. &quot;<i>I think that you have to know something of gangs, to be or
      have been a part of them, to be able to reach them.</i> Through the Paint
      the Town program, we were able to get gang members to work anonymously to
      paint over the graffiti. It gave us a chance to show them a program that
      can work with them, and teach them how to not put up graffiti.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Graffiti is a very visible part of a gang, with specific meaning for each
      gang, Dawson said. &quot;Most importantly, it defines the area a gang
      claims as its turf, but it also is used to show opposition -- even
      contempt -- for a rival gang,&quot; he said.<br>
      <br>
      During three &quot;Paint the Town&quot; days since 1994, more than 700
      volunteers have painted more than 200 gang graffiti sites with some
      $10,000 in donated painting products. A follow-up survey found that <i>only
      15 percent of 45 randomly selected sites had been repainted by a gang.</i><br>
      <br>
      Outside of his CES connection, Marquez and his wife, Zan, run &quot;Faith,
      Hope and Love&quot; with a group of other volunteers to <i>provide
      activities such as basketball, volleyball, fishing, camping trips and
      gardening for 8- to 12-year-old boys and girls</i>. Forty children
      participate now. They meet twice a week at the St. Patrick's School in
      Springfield.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What I do now feels good,&quot; Marquez said. &quot;And because it
      feels good, I want to do good for gang members who are here in
      Springfield. That's why we have 'Faith, Hope and Love' for the people
      here. There is faith, there is hope, and there is plenty of love
      here.&quot; </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#UIUC1996">University

    <p>Mike Knox (real name) was a police officer. He was a co-founder and
    member of the police gang unit. In that capacity he met many gang members,
    but one in particular caught his attention. In time, the two struck up a relationship and
    the gang member, now working his way away from gang activity, made
    presentations in local schools and other settings with Mike by his
    side.&nbsp;&quot;Mike changed my life,&quot; the former gang member said, &quot;He
    kept telling me if I didn't stop, I'd end up dead or in prison. I wish there
    were more guys out there like Mike.&quot; Sonic Drive-Ins sponsors their
    presentations. A caring officer, an interested gang member (now former gang
    member), and a corporate sponsor - a very profitable and worthwhile
    partnership.&nbsp;<font size="1">(<a href="http://www.gangguy.com/Ex-GangMember.html">page</a>)</font></p>
    <p>Seattle Street Connections, a group of reformed gang members in Seattle,

    <p>Tookie and Raymond were allegedly the two Los Angeles youths who started
    the gang
    called the Crips. Not only has Tookie become a reformed gang member, he was
    nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in turning youths away
    from gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1"><b>In 1987, Tookie began what became a 6 1/2-year stay
      in solitary confinement. After two years there, Tookie began to look at
      himself. He focused on the choices <i>he</i> had made in his life and then
      committed himself to make a drastic change. The long, difficult process he
      undertook to rebuild his character put him in touch with his true spirit,
      his own humanity. Only then could Tookie finally begin to care about the
      many children, mothers, fathers and other family members of this country
      hurt by the Crips legacy and by its explosive growth. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.tookie.com/">Tookie's
