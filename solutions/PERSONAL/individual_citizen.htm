individuals who live in it. You may have heard the

activity and youth violence in your community or neighborhood? At a minimum, you
can vote for tax increases
    which will expand opportunities for your community's children whether they
are at-risk or not and you can vote for school bonds to
    keep good kids good. You can take a leadership
    role in bringing about change in your neighborhood or you can

    should - come up with a solution of your own design, you could read through the sites shown below and choose any one or more of
    the many solutions discussed. Working through your local social institutions (like the ones listed
above)
    is one of the most effective ways in which you can help reduce gangs and youth

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">According to the <a href="http://www.search-institute.org/"> Search
Institute</a>, there are many ways in which individuals can contribute to a
reduction in gang
activity and youth violence. No matter what role you play relative to youths
know (i.e., parent, aunt, teacher, neighbor), there are ways you can help them
along the path of life. The Search Institute refers to
the need to build <a href="http://www.search-institute.org/assets"> developmental
assets</a>  among our youth - to help them become responsible, responsive, and caring
adults. The list of sites below indicate the ways in which you can contribute to
a child's growth in a meaningful and positive way. They are among the protective
factors <a href="../ISSUE/risk_protective.htm#Factors"> just discussed</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">The Search Institute also has
<a href="http://www.search-institute.org/content/40-developmental-assets-adolescents-ages-12-18">
good information on supporting young people with caring and attention, 
empowering then to use their abilities to help others, setting reasonable 
boundaries, helping them find constructive activities, sparking their commitment 
to learning, guiding them with positive values, helping them develop social 
competencies and life skills, and celebrating their uniqueness and affirming 
their positive identify</a>.</p>

One Person Can Do&nbsp;<br>
</font>
<font size="2" color="#0000FF">(An Extreme Example!)</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">In 1970 I had the good
fortune of meeting a young man named Gary Maher. At the time, he and Mimi 
Silbert were attempting
to establish an organization he called
<a href="http://www.grass-roots.org/usa/delancey.shtml">The
Delancey Street Foundation</a>. It is described as a leading self-help 
residential education center for former offenders and former substance abusers 
in the country. It is perhaps the largest, most innovative, and
most successful community-based program for ex-convicts in the United
States. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">The Delancey Street Foundation
is an example of an individual's dreams becoming a reality. As the idea grew in
Gary's and Mimi's minds, others were attracted to them and the vision they were developing. What
started out small has become significant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">Over time, a series of
buildings have been purchased which provide the ex-convicts with a place to live.
Training is also provided and a variety of businesses were established which are
staffed by the ex-convicts. Among the businesses are &quot;a moving and trucking school,
restaurant and catering services, print and copy shop, retail and wholesale
sales, advertising specialties sales, Christmas tree sales and decorating, and
an automotive service center, among others.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.hirenetwork.org/model_practices.html">page</a>)</font>.</p>
<p>During a two- to four-year stay at Delancey Street, residents learn social 
survival skills, and equally important, academic and vocational skills. Delancey 
Street supports itself primarily through a number of training schools, which 
provide vocational skills to all the residents while generating income through 
revenues earned from business services. </p>
<p>Training opportunities include a moving and trucking school, restaurant and 
catering services, print and copy shop, retail and wholesale sales, paratransit 
services, advertising specialties sales, Christmas tree sales and decorating, 
and an automotive service center, among others. More than 14,000 clients have 
graduated from the program. Delancey Street operates facilities in New Mexico, 
New York, North Carolina, Los Angeles and is headquartered in San Francisco.</p>

a Youth Finish School</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">Do you know a youth in the
community who is headed into or already getting in to trouble? Do you feel as
though you could approach this youth and encourage him or her to
    finish school? If you do, would it be worth a few dollars for you to pay for
the youth's GED (high-school equivalency degree)? Did you know it only costs a
few dollars? (It's $12 in one part of my community and free in another.) It takes the student time to complete the work, but the expense is
minor (although it may not be minor for the youth). How's that for a nice gift?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">The <a href="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/Biennial/126.html">High
School Equivalency Program </a>(HEP) helps persons 16 years of age or older who
are not currently enrolled in school to obtain the equivalent of a secondary
school diploma and subsequently to gain employment or begin postsecondary
education or training.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">The College Assistance Migrant
Program (CAMP) assists students enrolled in the first undergraduate year at an
institution of higher education to complete their program of study for that
year. Grants for both HEP and CAMP are made to institutions of higher education or to other nonprofit private agencies that cooperate with such
institutions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">Does your community offer this
kind of help? If not, maybe you could introduce the idea. By the way, there
are <a href="http://adulted.about.com/cs/finishhighschool/">other options</a>
for completing one's education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none" align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Other
Ways to Get Involved</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none">Becoming knowledgeable about
non-gang youth is, perhaps, even more important than being knowledgeable about
gang youth (there are far more non-gang youth). You can
<a href="http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/95708.pdf">learn how to
secure a safer future for youth</a> by exploring this site at the National Crime
Prevention Council's website (the site may load slowly on your computer). The Council also has some sage advise about
<a href="http://www.ncpc.org/">making
children, families, and communities safer from violence</a> (type <i>children 
violence </i>in the search box). Families also play an
important role in reducing gang and youth violence. That's the subject of the
next part of this chapter.</p>
