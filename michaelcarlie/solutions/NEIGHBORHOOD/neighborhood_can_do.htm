What Neighborhood
Residents Could Do</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
<p>The gangs discussed in <i>Into the Abyss</i> tend to identify themselves with
or conduct most of their activities in specific neighborhoods, not whole communities or cities. By focusing prevention,
intervention, suppression, and treatment efforts at the neighborhood level you will be targeting
the very heart of the problem. And in order for the solutions to be effective,
neighborhood residents need to get involved.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2"><b>Every neighborhood must take stock of
itself - really work to understand its strengths and weaknesses, particularly
learning where it is most vulnerable to losing disenfranchised youth to the lure
of street gangs. Then each neighborhood must capitalize upon its strengths in
order to overcome its weaknesses.&nbsp;</b> </font>
  </p>
<p><font size="2"><b> To do that, everybody must get involved. Keep
watch over a neighbor’s home. Volunteer to work with youth. Donate your time
and talent to neighborhood projects. Do something to contribute to your
neighborhood’s capacity for providing youth with opportunities to become
productive, law-abiding members of civil society. </b></font>
<font size="1"> (The Gang Crime Prevention
Center, Illinois, <a href="http://www.gcpc.state.il.us/about_gangs/">page</a> as 
of summer 2001, off the web as of December 2005)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many ways to get involved. You can recruit neighbors to get them
involved, participate in publicity mailings, or be a part of a phone chain (one
person calls two other people and each of them call two other people, and so on
until every one is called about an upcoming meeting or event). You can solicit door-to-door for the
cause or
participate in town meetings and the programs or events which are held.</p>
<p>Local residents will find that working with the police will also help deter 
gang activity. Community-oriented policing find police departments building 
partnerships with the neighborhoods they serve. The creation of sub-stations in 
gang-infested neighborhoods is an example of community-oriented policing. In 
their study of the Phoenix (AZ) Police Department's gang unit, Katz and Webb 
report what that department's managers see as valuable about a 
community-oriented approach.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font size="2"><b>My idea of the community approach ... I think they want 
	to form a partnership with the community, and one of the programs they put 
	in place is the area manager program, where they have a lieutenant assigned 
	to a specific area and he is the main person. It's like his own little 
	precinct for that community, and they go to that lieutenant with their 
	problems, and that lieutenant fans it out on how to deal with the problem. 
	To me, that's the biggest thing we've done ... move the police department as 
	far as precinct substations back into the community where they don't see us 
	as a taboo or something mysterious ... we're regular people, this is who we 
	are, and we're not going to fix your problem along - we need to fix the 
	problem together. </b></font> <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp;404)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What follows are some programs you may be interested in emulating or that may help you
think of other things which could be done in your community to reduce gang
activity and youth violence.</p>
