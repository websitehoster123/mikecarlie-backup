    <p>Because youth violence is a community problem, it is not a problem that
    either law enforcement, families, schools, human services, or community
    agencies can remedy alone. All members of the community (agencies and individuals)
    must work together
    in a coordinated effort to reduce gang activity and youth violence. Too
    often individuals and agencies work independently, sometimes even at odds
    with one another, as they compete for limited resources to accomplish
    their goals. The consequences of this competition have been less than
    desirable.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Currently there are numerous family, drug
    counseling, remedial education programs, etc., in existence in gang impacted
    communities. Unfortunately, many of these programs are so fragmented as to

      McBride</a>, 2000, p. 16)&nbsp;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Community leaders should be at the forefront of bringing the issue of
    collaboration to their
    community's attention. Collaboration requires that independent agencies
    figuratively join together in order to accomplish a specific goal. In this
    case, the goal is to bring a concerted effort to reducing gangs activity and
    youth violence. Each agency has something to offer and, together and working
    cooperatively, their efforts are magnified. At least that's the hope.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>Partnerships aren’t

    </blockquote>
    <p>Community leaders have the ability to convene community forums (to
    be discussed briefly), call on existing groups to assist in the effort, or form a council
    or task force that devotes its attention to gang activity and youth violence.&nbsp;
    The leaders need to encourage communities to focus on their youth, look at
    the resources they have available and the resources they need to develop,
    and select strategies that would best serve local youth given the community's needs, history, and culture.</p>
    <p align="left">There are many ways to go about developing a coalition. The
    following <i>Steps to Developing a Collaborative Effort</i> is a compendium
    of several of the best ideas I've found.<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Steps">Steps</a>
    to Developing a Collaborative Effort</font></b><p align="center"><font size="2"><b>It's
    the age of communication and we're not communicating!</b></font><p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Step
    1: Gather local data on gang activity and youth violence. </font></b>This
    may be obtained from police, newspaper accounts, juvenile officers,
    probation and parole officers, and school administrators.&nbsp; How much
    gang activity and youth violence is there, where is it occurring, what is
    the nature of that activity, what is being done about the problem, and what
    is not being done about it?&nbsp;<p align="left">Organize your findings and
    prepare a way of sharing them with those who attend the meeting that is
    going to be held (see Step 2). Additional information on the gang situation
    may also be revealed at the meeting.&nbsp;<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Step
    2: Get a small group of people together.</b></font> They should be
    representative of the agencies and organizations in your community with an interest in serving local
    youth. It may also include representatives from the neighborhoods in which
    most of the gang activity and youth violence is taking place. It doesn't
    have to be a large group. In fact, a small group may be able to do more
    things more quickly.
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">At the meeting,<b> <font color="#0000FF"> </font><font color="#008000"> define the

      violence) <b><font color="#008000">and</font></b> its <b><font color="#008000">impact
      on the community</font></b>. If presented properly, the data should move
      everyone to take action. The goal is for them to take collaborative
      action.<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">What is needed?</font><font color="#0000FF"> </font></b>A
      discussion should take place as to what is needed to reduce gang activity
      and youth violence. Some of those needs are likely to reflect what you
      read in <i><a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm#top">Why
      Gangs Form</a></i>. Others may be unique to your community. Knowing what
      the problem is and what is needed, the group can not identify what needs
      to be done to reduce the gang activity and youth violence.<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">Identify
      key stakeholders.</font><font color="#0000FF"> </font> </b>Identify the individuals, agencies, and
      organizations in town that are best able to provide that which is needed
      to reduce the gang activity and youth violence and who are the people who
      are most affected by the problem.&nbsp;
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Step 3: Convene the first coalition
    meeting.</font></b> It's time for the stakeholders and original members to
    meet. The purpose of this meeting, one of several which are sure to follow,
    is to share the findings and the vision of what is needed to reduce gang
    activity and youth violence in the community (or affected neighborhoods). Include
    the mayor, district representatives, the juvenile judge, chief prosecutor, and Chief of police. Not only may they be
    forthcoming in giving you some good ideas, you'll need their support later
    as you<b> </b> Identify individuals and organizations to participate in the
    next meeting.&nbsp;
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">Everyone present should be aware of the <a href="../ISSUE/is_there_a_gang_situation.htm"> signs of gang
    activity</a> and the extent of youth violence in the community. <i>A
    community unaware of a problem will not respond well to efforts
    to reduce it</i>.<p align="left"> Although there may be turf issues between
agencies or organizations represented at the meeting, these need to be
      recognized and
overcome for the long-term welfare of the community and its children. Consensus
      building is key - everyone should leave the meeting with a clear notion of
      the problem and the need for agencies to work together to solve the
      problem.
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">No agency or organization alone can deal

    effectiveness. </font></b><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Spergel1990">Spergel</a>,

    <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Step 4: Begin strategic

    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><b><font size="3">A. Take an Inventory of Community/Youth
    Needs</font></b>:<br>
    </font>Achieving collaboration is a
    process, and the process usually begins by taking an inventory
    of community needs. One of the most effective approaches being used today is the <i><a href="../ISSUE/risk_protective.htm">risk and
    protective factor</a></i> <a href="../ISSUE/risk_protective.htm"> approach</a> which identifies the risks
    youths face and
    assesses whether the factors needed to protect them from those risks exist
    in the community or not.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><b>B. Discuss Possible Courses of Action</b>:&nbsp;<br>
    </font>

    determine what the best course of action may be to address those needs.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><b>C. Develop a Coordinated Plan</b>:</font>&nbsp;<br>
    A plan of action is then developed, goals are established (i.e., reducing
    assaults in the schools, reducing the number of gang members in the
    community, expanding existing services, reducing the amount of graffiti in
    the neighborhood, increasing school attendance, lowering the dropout rate,
    finding summer employment for local youth, raising additional funds), and
    human, financial, and material resources are allocated. <i> Coordination
    of collaborative efforts and of the services or programs to be provided is
    paramount if the endeavor is to be successful.&nbsp;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Step 5. Implement the Plan:</b></font>
    The plan is then implemented and a previously-designated coordinator of the plan
    makes sure all aspects of the plan are implemented correctly. Youth
    violence and gangs are recurring problems, so the plan should build in
    continued momentum over the long-term. If reducing the number of dropouts
    from the schools is a goal, for example, then each year the goal is
    increased and the effort attempts to continually lower the dropout rate.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Step 6. Assess the
    Outcome and Carry On</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">Did the plan work? Are dropout rates coming down? Is there
    less graffiti? Assessment of the outcomes will provide feedback
    needed to continue, expand, or modify the plan because the
    desired goals are not being achieved. Address failures and celebrate
    successes no matter how large or small they may be.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">A useful and practical guide for building coalitions is available
    from the <a href="http://cadca.org/">Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America</a> (see
    Chapter 2). If you're serious about wanting to build a coalition, it's worth
    the small purchase price.&nbsp;<p align="left">Building coalitions and
    getting agencies and organizations to collaborate with one another is not an
    easy task. It may require more time than you had anticipated. My only advice
    would be to be patient and continue working toward your goal. The welfare of
    your community's children is worth the struggle.
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">An <a name="Ideal">Ideal</a> 
    Structure for
    Cooperation and Coordination</font></b>
    </p>

    <p>In an ideal world - and in a community which has accepted there is a gang
    situation which must be addressed - each social institution ( schools, faith and business communities, health care, government,
    media, and justice system) would have a specialist responsible for gathering gang
    activity and youth
    violence data. They would bring the information they have to the coalition
    meeting described above and to meetings of a <a href="task_force.htm">community
    task force</a> or <a href="forum.htm">community
    forum</a> on gangs and youth violence.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Schools, Faith, Business, Health Care, and
      Government: </font></b>The school representative would access to information on the
    concerns of students, parents, teachers, and administrators relative to gangs
    and youth violence. Likewise, the faith community, business, health care, and government representatives
    have concerns to share and would be able
    to provide insight, guidance, and resources at the coalition meeting.
    </p>

      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Mass Media:</font> </b>The media (print and
      broadcast) would have at least one reporter or anchor who is interested in
      the subject of gang activity and youth violence.&nbsp;By participating in
      the coalition meeting the media representative would be able to inform the
      entire community as to what is happening in town and provide accurate and timely information as a result of
      his or her interaction
    with the other task force and community forum participants.
    </p>

      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Justice System:</font></b> The police would have a gang specialist or
    gang unit, prosecutors would have one or two assistant prosecutors who specialize in gang cases, juvenile services (for juveniles) and
    probation/parole offices (for adults) would have gang specialists with <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/PP/do.htm#Formats">caseloads
    consisting primarily or exclusively of gang members</a> and all of these
    specialists would participate in the coalition meeting.
    </p>

      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Youth-Serving Agencies: </font></b>Youth-serving agencies in the community
      would be represented at the coalition meetings. This includes agencies
      providing substance abuse intervention,
    counseling, parenting skills agencies, as well as organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts,
      and Boys and
    Girls Club. Each community is unique in what it has to offer and all the
      youth-serving agencies should be invited to participate in the coalition.
    </p>

      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Neighborhood Representatives:</font></b>
      Neighborhood association representatives, particularly from neighborhoods
      most effected by gangs and youth violence, would have a representative at
      the coalition meetings.
    </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Having representatives from each social institution in the community,
    specialists on gangs from each component of the justice system, neighborhood
    representatives, and representatives from youth-serving agencies meet regularly
    would allow for a continual flow of information throughout the community. Like I said, it would
    be the ideal situation.&nbsp;Every sector of the community would know what the other was doing and
    each would cooperate with the other in coordinating their activities. This
    increases the potential impact of every action and avoids duplicity.
    </p>

    <p>The next four parts of this chapter deal other ways in which a
    neighborhood or community may address its gang situation: creating community forums, gang and youth violence task force groups,
    community-based youth agencies, and the Adopt and Agency program.
