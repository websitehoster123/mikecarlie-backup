    <p>All relatively modern explanations for human behavior suggest that people behave the way they do
    either as <i>a result of
    their own choice</i> or<i> in response to various forces which
    determine their behavior</i> for them. Those who accept the former theory
    (choice) believe in free will. Those who accept the latter explanation
    (various forces determine how humans behave) believe in determinism. Those
    who believe both are called soft-determinists. I would like to briefly explore each of these
    in light of the gang situation.</p>

    <p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>Why Gangs Form&nbsp;<br>
    According to Free Will Theorists</b></font></p>
    <p>Those who believe in free would accept the notion that <i>people form
    gangs because they want to and others join them for the same reason</i>.
    They would reject the notion that there are forces which act upon people and force
    them to form or join a gang. People join gangs because <i> they believe they
    will gain more pleasure
    then pain by joining the gang</i> and by participating in its activities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><i>The
    process</i> through which the individual passes along the way to becoming a
    gang member would be viewed as<i> a rational one</i>. If individuals think gang
    membership will benefit their situation in life, they will join a gang. If an
    individual joins a gang as a result of coercion (i.e., being forced to join
    by rivals), then joining was a rational decision in order to avoid the pain
    of not joining. No matter what, the individual has free will ... people <i>choose</i>
    their course in life and are personally responsible for their decisions.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000">How to Reduce Gang </font></b><font color="#008000"><b>Formation&nbsp;<br>
    According to Free Will Theorists</b></font></p>
    <p>Were someone who believes in free will to entertain ways in which to
    solve the gang situation they would likely choose to do two things: increase
    the number of choices individuals have to make and/or increase the degree of
    punishment they suffer as a consequence of their inappropriate behavior.</p>
    <p>Some individuals who become involved in gang activity do so because they
    are unaware of other ways to fulfill the same needs that joining a gang may
    fulfill or they are denied access to them. Through the offering of other opportunities (i.e., summer
    employment, job training, remedial education), potential gang members may
    choose socially appropriate ways to earn income, gain respect and power, and
    therefore decide against joining a gang.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> If, as free will thinkers' believe,
    most people are rational, then the <i>rational</i> thing for them to do is
    to choose to reach the socially legitimated goal (financial success) using legitimate means rather than
    illegitimate ones - providing the residents and social institutions in the
    community allow them to do so. Where the individual encounters barriers
    (i.e., discrimination), it is the community which needs to be changed.</p>
    <p>A person who believes in free will may also suggest increasing the
    punishment meted out for being in a gang. That would be another <i>rational</i> thing to do. Increasing the pain associated with being in
    a gang should discourage hedonistic people from being involved in them. In order to get
    gang members to cease and desist in their gang behavior one should increase the
    pain associated with gang affiliation. What needs to be changed is the individual's calculation of
    pleasure and pain.</p>
    <p>As the concept of free will developed, the notion that everyone had free
    will and was rational was abandoned in favor of the notion
    that <i>most</i> people have free will and most were rational. The people who did not have free will and/or were irrational included the
    mentally deficient, the very young (&quot;too young to know better&quot;)
    and other misfits. For them, no pain would be sufficient to alter their
    behavior as they lacked the free will or rationality to respond to it
    meaningfully. For them, treatment, instead of punishment and the pain it
    causes, would be the wiser course of action.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Application</b></p>
      <p>I find the free will explanation for gang formation and gang joining
      useful for people who do, in fact, have free will. If everyone has an
      equal opportunity to get a good education and enter the job market on an
      even playing field, then the free will explanation makes sense. If,
      however, someone (or a class of people) is denied access to a good education or a good job, then
      the free will explanation is only a justification for punishing the unfortunate.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Determinism</font></b></p>
    <p>Determinists believe most human behavior is determined by forces outside
    the control of the individual - in other words, people do <i>not</i> have
    free will. They believe the forces that <i>determine</i> the way people
    behave are:</p>

    According to Determinists</b></font></p>
    <p>According to determinists, gangs form and people join them as a result of
    biological, psychological, and/or socio-cultural pressures. There is little
    in the research which speaks to <b> biological</b> determinism as regards gangs. It
    would be a stretch, for example, to suggest that one somatotype or body type
    (i.e., Sheldon's <font size="1">[<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Sheldon1944">1944</a>]
    </font>typology of the muscular or mesomorphic body type, overweight or
    endomorphic type, or slender and frail ectomorphic type) is more likely to
    get involved in a gang than another or that neurological or biological deficiencies
    which may result in poor academic performance also cause certain people to
    form a gang or join one.</p>
    <p>There is, however, much that could be said about psychological and
    socio-cultural reasons for gang formation and gang joining. Among the <b>
    psychological</b> explanations are the influence of <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/pathological.htm">pathological
    offenders</a>, forming or joining a gang in response to <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/fear_and_a_lack_of_security.htm">fear</a>,
    or for increasing one's level of <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/self_esteem.htm">self-esteem</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Socio-cultural</b> explanations abound and include the need to: identify a <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/rite_of_passage.htm">rite
    of passage</a> from childhood to adolescence and from adolescence to young

    <p>While the option of isolating or eliminating people who exhibit certain biological or
    psychological abnormalities may sound drastic, that is one approach to the
    gang phenomenon and is referred to as <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/tactics.htm#Suppression">suppression</a>.
    Our willingness (and perhaps need) to arrest and either incarcerate or
    execute certain gang members is part and parcel of our nation's social
    policy regarding gangs.</p>
    <p>As for psychological and socio-cultural explanations for human behavior,
    they reflect the majority opinion as to why gangs form and why certain
    youths join them and are the backbone of <a href="../solutions.htm#top">solutions</a>
    described in <i>Into the Abyss</i>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b>Application</b></p>
      <p>I support the determinist's position that there are forces over which
      individuals may not have control. I need only consider the power of
      socio-cultural forces such as gender, social class, age, and
      discrimination as they impact people and their lives to understand why
      some youths may form or join a gang to accomplish their goal - whatever it
      may be.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Soft Determinism</font></b></p>
    <p>Soft determinists accept that people are at the mercy of biological,
    psychological, and social or cultural forces but that, in the end, each is
    responsible for determining how he or she responds to the situations life
    presents. For soft determinists, punishment for wrong doing followed by
    treatment makes sense. And prevention makes the most sense of all.</p>
    <p>I entertained the notion of including a section on sociological or
    criminological theories of gang formation, but there are precious few and
    they are all contested.
    Instead, there are a multiplicity of theories about why some people violate
    the law. Jankowski (1991) makes note of this fact.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The sociological literature on gangs offers a number
      of theories, but a close look at each of these indicates that they are
      really theories about delinquency and not theories about gangs per se.
      They are therefore sociological theories of crime rather than sociological
      theories of the gang. This has included what each has focused on, and it
      has produced similar and limited explanations concerning the behavior of
      gangs and why they persist. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Jankowski1991">Jankowski</a>,
      1991, p. 21)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A good theory has as its key features the ability to predict future
    events and explain phenomenon both broadly in scope and with great
    precision. There are no such theories of either why gangs form or why
    certain youths join them. <i>Into the Abyss</i>, in fact, is unique in its
    focus on <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm">why
    gangs form</a>, but the explanations it offers do not rise to the level of
    &quot;theory.&quot; I don't know if <i>any</i> explanation of human behavior
    ever will.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Free Will, Determinism, and
    Solutions</font></b></p>
    <p>The next section of <i>Into the Abyss</i> focuses on ways to reduce gang
    activity and youth violence - solutions, if you will. Free will and
    deterministic explanations for human behavior provide a frame of reference
    for understanding the reasoning for implementing one solution or another.
    Prevention (i.e., education programs), for example, is based upon the notion
    of free will. Once educated about the dangers of being in a gang, it is
    assumed the people being educated will use their rational abilities and
    determine that joining a gang will bring more pain than pleasure, hence,
    they will not join. Suppression works on the same principle in hopes that
    increasing the pain associated with being in a gang (i.e., arrest, being
    stigmatized as a gang member/offender, incarceration and loss of freedom)
    will result in leaving the gang.</p>
    <p>Solutions which speak to changes other than in gang members (i.e.,
    efforts to reduce racial and ethnic discrimination, improve schools,
    increase job opportunities) are built upon the deterministic notion that
    forces in a society or culture influence how its members behave. Offering
    psychological counseling, too, is based upon the determinist notion that
    one's behavior is determined by his or her psychological make-up. A soft
    determinist may suggest that these forces (social or psychological) impact
    the <i>choices</i> the individual has to make.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The point is that for a solution to make sense, it should be built either
    upon a free will or deterministic interpretation of why gangs form or a
    combination of both.&nbsp;</p>
