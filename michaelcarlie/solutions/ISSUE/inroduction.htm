    <p>I think this is the most important part of <i>Into the Abyss</i>. Finding
    ways to prevent the <i> formation</i> of gangs should be our primary goal. Preventing their formation is
    less costly, less time consuming, and certainly more effective in the
    long-term than
    intervention and suppression efforts. Even Howell <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">2000</a>)</font>,
    who questions whether we know enough about prevention to be effective, has
    hope.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Preventing children and adolescents from joining
      gangs may be the most cost-effective solution, but little is known about
      how to do this. Providing alternatives for potential or current gang
      members appears to hold promise, particularly if gang conflicts are
      mediated at the same time.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>An antigang curriculum, especially if combined with
      afterschool or antibullying programs, may be effective. Because predictors
      for joining a gang and remaining in a gang span multiple domains -
      individual problems, family variables, school problems, peer group
      associations, and community conditions - programs that address multiple
      components appear to the most effective.</b></font><font size="1">
      (Howell, <a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">2000</a>,

    <p>Maybe we can't get rid of gangs where they are already <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#entrenchment">
	entrenched</a>, but the battle isn't over yet. The following model may be 
	instructive as it includes a useful way of looking at the gang situation and 
	incorporates all four methods for reducing gang formation and gang activity 
	(prevention, intervention, suppression, and re-entry socialization).</p>
					          <p>I use the term &quot;containment&quot; to refer to 
								containing the growth of gangs and the behavior 
								gang members. Most people who join street gangs 
								also leave them. They may leave them by being 
								killed, injured, hospitalized, locked up, or by 
								simply getting married, finding employment, 
								moving away, or by other means. Here's how 
								containment works:</p>

	<p>By pushing the age of gang joining later and helping terminate membership 
	earlier, we are left to contend with the most active and dedicated gang 
	members. The objective then would be to reduce the amount of harm inflicted 
	by those who remain in the gangs, thus the emphasis on suppression, 
	introducing programs such as the Boston Gun Project (to reduce killings by 
	firearm, the most common form of inflicting death among gang members), and 
	other violence-reduction efforts.</p>
	<p>There are still gang-free communities which will grow and
new communities which will be born. We can take effective action now
to increase the likelihood that those communities remain free, or relatively free, of gangs. Working individually and together,
    we can reduce the amount of gang
    activity occurring in our neighborhoods and reduce the forces which cause
    gangs to form. That is an important message. All hope is not lost.</p>

    Situation</font></b></p>
    <p>One thing which has become clear to me over the past three years is that
    we must learn about the nature of the gangs and gang members
    which populate <b>our own community or neighborhood </b>before any
    meaningful action may be taken. Generalizations about gangs in the United States are meaningless as concerns designing
    ways in which to reduce gang activity found in one's own neighborhood.&nbsp;In this regard, an understanding of one's <b>local </b> gang situation should guide
    a community's or neighborhood's anti-gang efforts. This prerequisite for
    effective action is also supported by research conducted by the U.S. Office of
    Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Community responses to gangs must begin with a
      thorough assessment of the specific characteristics of the gang
      themselves, crimes they commit, other problems they present, and
      localities they effect. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">Howell</a>,
      2000, p. 53)&nbsp;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In order to take effective action, however, a neighborhood must
    acknowledge its gang situation, not deny it. Nor should the residents
    overreact to the gang situation. &quot;Denial that gang problems exist
    precludes early intervention efforts. Overreaction in the form of excessive
    police force and publicizing of gangs may inadvertently serve to increase a
    gang's cohesion, facilitate its expansion, and lead to more crime.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">Howell</a>,
    2000, p. 53)&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Acquiring Needed <a name="Data"> Data</a></font></b></p>
    <p>A variety of
    sources should be tapped to obtain accurate data on one's local gang situation. Police, particularly if they have begun to
    differentiate between gang- and non-gang-related crimes, can provide
    valuable information to guide an anti-gang effort. Juvenile officers, probation and parole officers, school officials,
    youth-serving agencies in the community, local residents, and prosecutors
    experienced in working with gang members add an important dimension to a
    community's understanding of its gang situation. And, as Howell <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">2000</a>)
    </font>notes, outside expertise may also be needed.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Because gang problems vary from one community to
      another, police, courts, corrections, and community agencies often need
      assistance from gang experts in assessing their gang problem(s) and in developing
      appropriate and measured responses.</font></b><font size="2"> </font><font size="1">(Howell,
      <a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">2000</a>,
      p. 53.)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">What kind of data should be collected? In addition to the
    number of gang-related (gang-motivated and gang-member crimes) crimes, you
    may also want data which measures the causes of gang formation. How much
    child abuse is there in the community? How much teen pregnancy? How many
    single parents living below the poverty level? How much unemployment among
    the poor? What are the rates of truancy and dropping out from local schools?
    How many children are fatherless?</p>
    <p align="left">There are other meaningful indicators of an at-risk
    population. Local social service providers are usually well aware of what
    those indicators are. Once data on the indicators is collected it is also
    suggested that the data be collected annually as a measure of how the
    community is doing in reducing the indicators over time. The data may also
    be used as a way to measure the effectiveness of efforts to reduce gang
    activity and youth violence. Reducing the causes of gang formation may also
    reduce child abuse and teen pregnancy rates and other problems some youth
    are experiencing.</p>

    that</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">When communities decide to take action to deal with gang problems, it

    <p>Rather than bite off more than one can chew, or more than an entire
    community can chew, psychologist Karl Weick<font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#BJA1997">1997</a>)</font>
    suggests we take little bites and go for small wins.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">A more
    constructive approach is to take large problems and break them into smaller,
    more manageable ones, such as addressing graffiti at a specific location
    rather than citywide. This approach allows for the development of

      &quot;A small win is a concrete, complete, implemented outcome of moderate

    </blockquote>
    <p>Small wins have the potential for attracting
    more attention to the effort to reduce gang activity and youth violence and getting more citizens involved in problem
    solving. It also reduces resistance to efforts which may be undertaken in

    <p>With this way of looking at larger problems surrounding the
    formation of gangs and solutions to those problems, let's take a look at
    various strategies which may be used for reducing gang activity.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Strategies for <a name="Reducing"> Reducing</a> the Gang
    Phenomenon</font></b></p>
    <p>All solutions are either proactive, reactive, or suppressive. <b>Proactive
    solutions are focused upon prevention</b>  (i.e., keeping children from
    joining gangs and behaving badly). <b>Reactive
    solutions involve intervention </b>(helping gang members leave the gang 
	environment). <b>Suppressive
    solutions emphasize<font color="#990033"> </font>arrest and removal from the
    community</b>. In an ideal world, after suppression (arrest and conviction) 
	comes <b>treatment </b>in a correctional environment (in the community or in an 
	institution). </p>
	<p>According to Spergel et al., <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SpergelCurry1994">1994</a>)</font>, there are five basic strategies for dealing with youth
    gangs:&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">1) Neighborhood mobilization.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">This refers to bringing neighborhood residents
      together in order to reach a common understanding of the problem (what
      gang activity is taking place, where, and by whom), identify possible
      causes for the gang behavior, ways to solve the problem (reduce the gang
      presence and activity), and ways to implement an action plan to reach that
      goal.</font></b></p>
    </blockquote>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">2) Social intervention, especially youth outreach and
    work with street gangs.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">This is typically done by trained social workers
      and/or probation and parole officers.</font></b></p>
    </blockquote>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">3) Provision of social and/or economic opportunities
    such as special school and job programs.</font><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">This may include in-school and extra-curricular
      programs as well as job training and placement.</font></b></p>
    </blockquote>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">4) Gang suppression and incarceration.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">This refers to the arrest and detention of core and incorrigible
      gang members. In addition, it should be accompanied by treatment programs
      while incarcerated (i.e., drug counseling, teaching parenting skills, job
      training, completing elementary and secondary education degrees).</font></b></p>
    </blockquote>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">5) Organizational development strategy.</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">In particular, this refers to having specialized gang
      units of practitioners in the police department, juvenile and probation
      services, and in the prosecutor's office.&nbsp; </font></b> <font size="1">(Spergel,
      <a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SpergelCurry1994">1994</a>,
    p. 7)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Unfortunately, Spergel has omitted treatment following conviction. That 
	is discussed in <i>Into the Abyss </i>in 
	<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/michaelcarlie/SOLUTIONS/INSTITUTIONS/jails_prisons.htm">Chapter 25, Part 3, Topic 6</a>. </p>
	<p><i>Intertwined</i> with Spergel's strategies are concerns for <b>preventing</b> the
    development of <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm#top">the
    forces which cause gang formation</a>, <b>intervening<i> </i></b>with youth
    who are motivated to get out of a gang or stop their decent into a gang, and
    <b>suppression</b>.
    We'll return to these three underlying strategies and related concerns later in
    the
    book.</p>
    <p>The solutions to gang activity that a neighborhood may explore should be
    related to whether the neighborhood in question is a gang-free-, emerging-,
    or chronic gang neighborhood. <i> Gang-free</i> neighborhood residents need to be
    vigilant.&nbsp;Prevention is the most valuable strategy for them to use.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><i>Gang emergent </i> neighborhoods need to focus on both prevention (to keep
    more youth from joining the gangs) and intervention (helping marginally involved
    youths get out of the gang) while <i> chronic gang</i> communities need to focus
    on all three underlying strategies: prevention, intervention, and suppression
    (ideally with treatment).</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">To conserve resources and most
      effectively deal with the youth gang problem, it is important to target
      certain communities, organizational contexts, gangs, and gang members or
      gang-prone youth. Neighborhoods and organizations, particularly schools,
      experiencing serious gang problems, should be priority targets for
      suppression and intervention efforts. The most serious gang problem youths
      in the most violent gangs in the highest gang crime rate areas should be
      targeted first.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Also, individual youth should be
      targeted in the following order of priority purposes. First, leadership
      and core gang youths--to disrupt gang networks, protect the community, and
      facilitate the reintegration of these youths through community-based or
      institutional programming into legitimate pursuits.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Second, high-risk gang-prone youth who
      are often younger or aspiring gang members who give clear indication of
      beginning participation in criminal gang activities--to prevent further
      criminal gang involvement through early intervention, preferably
      community-based services.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Third, regular and peripheral gang
      members--to generally address their needs for control and intervention
      services.&quot; </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Kane1992">Kane</a>,
      1992, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/d0023.txt">page</a>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another approach involves matching the underlying strategy (prevention,
    intervention, suppression, treatment in the correctional environment) with the level of an individual's gang
    involvement. The following chart provides an example of how this approach
    works.&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Our <a name="Focus"> Focus</a> of Attention</font></b></p>
    <p>Prevention efforts, in addition to emphasizing the importance of staying out
of gangs, should also emphasize the importance of staying <b>in</b> something that
is positive and acceptable. Youths need to be rewarded for doing the right
    thing.&nbsp;Too often we focus our attention on the youths who are behaving badly and
    overlook the youths who are behaving well - and they are the majority of our
    youth. We should focus the majority of our attention and resources upon 
	those who are behaving well.<b> Keeping good kids good</b>. After
    all, when neglected and overlooked, some of them will likely turn to deviant behavior just
    to get attention.</p>
    <p>There is no one solution for the problems gangs present because typically there is no one cause for their formation. If local residents and their chosen leaders approach gang issues
    as though they were sculptors working in clay they will add a little of <i>this</i>
    (i.e., a job training and placement program, an alternative high school
    equivalency program), take away a little of <i>that</i>  (i.e., rely less on
    incarceration for minor gang/drug offenders and offer a Drug Court
    program in its place) and, in the end, the neighborhood or community will
    have a uniquely sculpted and effective way to reduce its unique gang situation.</p>
    <p>The goal is to reduce the size of gangs (by keeping fewer youths from joining
    them and/or join them later, and helping
    current members leave the gang), their impact on victims and co-victims (i.e., non-gang-member family,
    friends, teachers), and the frequency and seriousness of gang member criminal activity.
    These are realistic and achievable goals.</p>
    <p>There are two Parts in this chapter. In Part 1 we will discuss the
    process of identifying if there is a gang in the neighborhood and the steps
    which may be taken to make this determination. In Part 2 we will look at the
    risk factors which result in some youths joining a gang and the
    protective factors which inhibit that process.&nbsp;</p>
