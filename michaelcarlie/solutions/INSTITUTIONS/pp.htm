  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Offenders placed on <i> probation</i> are typically sentenced to
    treatment in the community for a specific period of time while under
    the supervision of a probation officer. In many cases, an equally long
    prison sentence is imposed along with the sentence to probation, but it is &quot;suspended&quot; - held in abeyance.
    If the offender serves he or her probation without violating its conditions, the suspended sentence to
    incarceration is dismissed.</p>
    <p align="left">Offenders on <i> parole</i> were sentenced to prison, served a portion
    of their time in the prison, and, because they behaved well while
    incarcerated, were released into the community under
    the supervision of a parole officer. Both probationers and parolees are
    required to abide by certain <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/PP/difference_between.htm#conditions"> conditions</a> while in the community which, if violated, may result
    in revocation (loss) of their probation/parole status. When probation or
    parole are revoked, the offender is incarcerated for the remainder of their
    original sentence.</p>
    <p align="left">There are both juvenile- and adult probation and parole officers. Juvenile officers perform many of
    the same functions of a probation or parole officer, but their caseload is
    made up exclusively of juveniles. The solutions discussed in the remainder
    of this section apply to probation and parole officers as well as juvenile
    officers (hereafter all are referred to as &quot;officers&quot;).</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>When the court
      determines that a juvenile offender may remain in the community, the most
      frequently ordered disposition is probation supervision. Unfortunately,
      probation becomes meaningless when juveniles are assigned to overburdened
      probation officers who at best can have brief and infrequent contacts with
      them in sterile office settings.</b></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>However, probation
      supervision that remains true to its theoretical purpose and incorporates
      critical elements such as small caseloads, opportunistic supervision, and
      community involvement can effectively hold youth accountable for their
      behavior. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Kurlycheketal1999">Kurlychek,
      et al.</a>, 1999 , <a href="http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/pubs/jaibgbulletin/exemp.html#3">page</a>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Due to overwhelming caseloads (in number and in the variety of
    pathologies exhibited), most officers have become brokers of community services. They know what their clients need and
    which services (social agencies) are available in the community to help
    them. The work of the officers, then, is to match their clients to the
    appropriate services in the community. Instead of offering such things as
    counseling, tutoring, mentoring, or substance abuse intervention themselves,
    they send clients to agencies in the community for those services.</p>
    <p align="left">The extent to which any of the officers can assist their clients
    depends upon the intelligence,
    foresight, and generosity of the community and the willingness of the
    officer to avail themselves of those services. Some probation/parole
    officers, faced with too many clients, sort them into categories, for lack
    of a better term. I have often heard officers say &quot;There's about a
    third of my clients who can't be helped. They don't want help and it's a
    waste of my time and the resources of the community to push help on them.
    Then there's about a third of my clients who don't need any additional help.
    They are genuinely sorry they did what they did, their parents are on their
    case, and matters will improve for them without much assistance from me.
    Then there's the final third - the ones who need help and are willing to be
    helped. Those are the ones I focus my time and effort on.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">If community leaders and
    residents recognize the need for and value of community-based treatment for
    offenders, and are willing to provide the resources needed, then the amount of gang activity and youth violence in the
    community may be reduced through their use. If they don't have that
    foresight, offenders will not be treated nor will gang activity or crime
    subside.</p>
    <p align="left">If the resources are available, here are some of the ways in
    which officers could contribute to a reduction in
    gang activity and youth violence.</p>
