    <p>When I think about what could be done in the field of corrections to
    reduce gang activity and youth violence my mind goes back to an interview
    with <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/story.htm">Jose</a>,
    a former Hispanic gang member from Santa Anna, California. He said &quot;We need some anti-gang programs in the detention centers
    where these kids are first exposed to gang stuff. After that, it's too late.
    Any change is going to have to come from inside the person after that. But
    if you can get to them before they get into the life, that's better. You
    have a better chance of keeping them from getting in in the first
    place.&quot;</p>
    <p>Jose's comments highlight the importance of offering anti-gang and
    anti-youth-violence programs in detention centers to juveniles <i>at the earliest age possible</i>.
    Available data indicate there are many children in detention who claim to be
    involved in a gang. <font size="1">(Howell,
      <a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">2000</a></font>)&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2"><a name="detention"></a>[The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
      Prevention sponsored a] survey [which] covers gang problems and
      interventions in detention centers. Nearly 9 in 10

      of the detention centers said that one-third or more of their inmates
      belonged to a gang.&nbsp;Slightly more than half of the detention centers
      reported gang-related assaults, almost half
      reported problems with gangs recruiting
      members, nearly one-third reported threats or intimidation of staff, and
      one-fourth reported threats or intimidation of nongang members. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">Howell</a>,

    <p>I also remember sitting in an interview room inside a Federal
    Penitentiary interviewing a gang member inmate whose
    life was, for all intents and purposes, a complete loss. He dropped out of
    elementary school and never returned, started running with a gang,
    was arrested more times than he could remember, served several prison terms,
    and had absolutely no plans for the future.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Those two encounters, and dozens of others like them, have kept me
    focused on the need to offer gang members in confinement an alternative to
    gangs. They are captive audiences and may, under the right
    circumstances, gain something of value from positive programmatic and
    one-on-one encounters. We need to pay attention to gang members in
    confinement due to the disturbing relationship between gangs in prison and
    gangs on the street. According to Howell <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">2000</a>)</font></p>

		prison gang members’ internal and external communications, and the 
		case-by-case examination of prison gang offenses.&nbsp;There are, however, no 
		published research evaluations testing the efficacy of these suppression

		inside correctional institutions.</b></font></p>

	,
	</font></b>while noting the lack of evaluation studies showing their 
	effectiveness, provide the following outline and overview of 
	corrections-related responses to gangs.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Isolating gang leaders has become a popular control 
		strategy.&nbsp;With a prison gang leader locked down, vertical communication 
		within the gang ideally would weaken and the prison gang group’s 
		solidarity eventually would deteriorate.&nbsp;One version of isolating prison 
		gang leaders is to transfer them among institutions or keep them 
		circulating between prisons.&nbsp; There are no published evaluations of 
		isolation and/or “bus therapy.”</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Another attempt to reduce gang membership is 
		“jacketing.”&nbsp;This involves putting an official note in an inmate’s file 
		if he is suspected of being involved with a gang.&nbsp;This note follows him 
		in prison and allows authorities to transfer him to a high-security 
		facility.&nbsp; Many find this process inappropriate because it may involve 
		suspected but unconfirmed gang activity, often reported by a snitch, 
		which leads to incorrectly labeling an inmate as a prison gang member or 
		associate.&nbsp;When so labeled, an inmate can be controlled with threats of 
		segregation and transfer.&nbsp;There are no published evaluations of this 
		approach either.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Correctional agencies now use databases to track 
		prison gang members and gang activities.&nbsp; This allows for effective 
		communication between a correctional agency and a state police agency 
		and improves data accuracy because data can be entered as soon as they 
		are gathered.&nbsp; The New York City Department of Correction uses a system 
		that allows for digitized photos that document gang members’ marks 
		and/or tattoos.&nbsp; Database searches can be done by a tattoo, scar, or 
		other identifying marks.&nbsp; The speed and capacity to update intelligence 
		information make the use of a shared database an effective tool in 
		prison gang management.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Providing alternative programming could become part 
		of prison gang management strategy; however, prison gang members have 
		not embraced such programming.&nbsp;The Hampden County Correctional Center in 
		Ludlow, Massachusetts, developed a graduated program for prison gang 
		members wanting to leave segregation.&nbsp; The program uses movies; 
		discussion sessions, and homework.&nbsp;At the program’s end, participants 
		must write a statement certifying they will no longer participate in 
		gang activities.&nbsp;Two years into the program, 190 inmates were enrolled 
		and 17 were returned to segregation for gang activities.&nbsp; Details of the 
		program’s evaluation are not available.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Another control strategy is the use of out-of-state 
		transfers, which send key prison gang members out of state in the hope 
		of stopping or slowing a prison gang’s activities.&nbsp; If a gang already 
		has been established, it is hoped that such a transfer would disrupt a 
		gang to the point of its demise; however, there are no data showing the 
		effectiveness of this type of control strategy.&nbsp; In fact, transferring a 
		high-ranking prison gang member could be the impetus to transfer his 
		prison gang to yet another institution.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Correctional agencies have tried to weaken prison 
		gangs by assigning members of different prison gangs to the same work 
		assignment and living quarters in anticipation of limiting the power of 
		one prison gang over another at a specific place.&nbsp; The Texas Department 
		of Corrections, for instance, assigned prison gang members to two or 
		three high-security lockdown institutions. Illinois tried this approach 
		to no avail because the inmate prison gang population was too large to 
		control effectively within a few locations.&nbsp; Illinois developed a 
		“gang-free” institution near Springfield, but as yet there are no 
		published evaluations of its effectiveness on reducing 
		gang-related/motivated crime within the Illinois Department of 
		Corrections. (Citations omitted to save space. You may view the original 
		work which includes the omitted citations.)</b></font></p>

	<p>What follows are solutions which may be implemented in
    detention centers (which hold juveniles awaiting court appearances), jails
    (which typically hold adults awaiting trial or persons convicted of
    misdemeanors and serving less than one year in confinement), and prisons
    (which are for adult felons serving terms of one year or more or awaiting
    execution).</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000" size="2">More program development
    is needed to prevent gang formation, help separate offenders from gangs,
    diminish the effectiveness of their recruitment efforts in detention
    centers, and prevent and reduce victimization of staff and fellow inmates.
    Progress in these areas should help break the cycle of gang members moving
    from detention centers and correctional facilities to prisons to

    <p>More and more juveniles are being sent to court and to detention.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">The
    increase in the number of delinquency cases handled by the courts has driven
    the growth in the number of juveniles in the detention system. In 1987, 1.2
    million delinquency cases were disposed in juvenile courts. By 1996, this
    number had risen 49%, to almost 1.8 million. This increase in the volume of
    juveniles in the justice system resulted in a 38% increase in the number of
    delinquency cases that involved the use of detention.</font></b> <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#MacKenzienodate">MacKenzie</a>,

    of educational deficiencies, vocational skills development
    (apprenticeships), drug abuse/use values and behavior change and treatment,

    <p>There is one form of incarceration which I did not yet discuss - boot
    camps. Structured like a military boot camp (requiring strict regimentation,
    compliance to all orders, and tolerance for punitive reprimands for
    disobedience), the creators of correctional boot camps believed errant youths needed structure and
    discipline.</p>
    <p>Although there have been repeated attempts to measure whether a boot camp
    experience alters the behavior of its residents over the long-term, few
    studies have been conclusive. The best evidence we have supports the
    notion that boot camp, alone, is not effective. When coupled with education
    programs and vocational training/experience, however, there is a glimmer of hope.</p>

    present time is not suitable. They lack the educational and vocational
    programming needed and have no follow-up services after release. I think a
    mentoring program must be installed in the follow-up or post-release stage

    <p>That brings us to the end of our review of justice system solutions. As
    you've probably noticed, much of what the justice system does to reduce gang activity and youth
    violence relies upon <a href="alternative_sentencing.htm#agencies"> a network of community-based social service agencies</a> -
    many of which serve youth. Our attention now shifts to those agencies and what they
    could do to reduce gang activity and youth violence.</p>
