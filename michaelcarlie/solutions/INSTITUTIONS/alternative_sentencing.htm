Alternative Sentencing as a
Solution</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In most cases, if a juvenile delinquent or criminal offender is given an alternative
    sentence it is to some form of treatment or punishment in the community
    rather than <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Incarceration">incarceration</a>.
    There are a few exceptions, one of which is the relatively new &quot;blended
    sentence.&quot; In a blended sentence, a juvenile offender who has committed a serious
    crime will receive a sentence which combines both a juvenile sentence and an
    adult sentence.</p>
    <b>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2">Following the lead of Minnesota, some other states are
      adopting what is referred to as a blended sentence for certain juvenile
      offenders - usually those who have committed violent, but not extreme or
      murderous, crimes. Such sentences combine both a juvenile sentence and an
      adult one.</font>
      <p><font size="2">Normally, youths convicted of such crimes are tried as
      adults, spend time in an adult prison and emerge with adult criminal
      records. But in Minnesota, if they comply with the terms of the juvenile
      sentence - which includes longer and more intensive supervision than a
      typical juvenile sanction - they will eventually be released without the
      stain of an adult criminal record. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NCPAaddress">National
      Center for Policy Analysis</a>, no date, 
		<a href="http://www.ncpa.org/pi/crime/feb98a.html">page</a>, off the 
		Internet as of April, 2010.)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another exception involves a sentence which begins with a 120 day period
    of confinement in a state prison during which the offender undergoes a
    rigorous substance abuse treatment program. The offender is then placed on
    parole, returned to the community, is required to participate in a
    community-based follow-up program, and finishes his or her sentence on
    parole.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The kinds of alternative sentences I want to focus on, however, do not
    include a period of confinement - they are sentences to community-based
    treatment. These alternative sentences have been a focus of debate for the past two
    decades. The only way to reduce prison overcrowding (other than having everyone behave well and
    be law abiding) is to build more
    prisons or legalize behaviors which are currently illegal.&nbsp;Building more
    prisons is too expensive and legalization (of drugs, for example), if it
    ever comes about, may take decades. Alternative sentencing is a good thing in
    this regard. It relieves the pressure on prisons and reduces overcrowding. On the other hand, some view alternative sentences as being
    &quot;soft on crime&quot; and are a bad thing ... and so goes the debate.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    The fact is, alternative sentencing makes
    more sense than incarceration for the public in general and for certain
    offenders in particular. Alternative sentences to community-based treatment are less expensive than incarceration, less likely
    to produce recidivism (reoffending), keep
    offenders employed (if they had a job up to the time they were sentenced),
    allow offenders to maintain contact with family members (hoping they are a
    good influence, as they sometimes are), and avoid all the negative consequences
    of incarceration (i.e., abuse, lack of treatment, loss of employment and
    family and discrimination upon release).</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>It is obvious that
      putting people in jail is not solving the problem. In fact, many argue
      that jail just makes it worse, especially for young people and women with
      dependent children. Young people become hardened and learn bad habits from
      fellow inmates. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#DrugPolicyEducationGroup">The
      Drug Policy Education Group</a>, 2001,

    </blockquote>
    <p>If there is any promise of having a positive impact on a gang offender as
    a result of his or her appearance in court, it is the imposition of an
    alternative sentence.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/wworks.txt"><i>Promising
    Interventions as Alternatives to Incarceration</i></a> is a compendium of
    successful alternative sentences/programs. It is a valuable tool for juvenile justice
    professionals seeking appropriate prevention and treatment programs in order
    to deter future delinquency.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>In the 1970's, the message issued by the research
    community concerning the use of prevention and treatment programs for
    juveniles was that &quot;nothing works.&quot; This unfortunate and, as it
    turned out, erroneous conclusion, together with increasing serious juvenile
    delinquency, fueled confinement of larger numbers of juveniles throughout
    the 1980's. Juveniles were increasingly turned over to the criminal courts.
    These trends continue to this day.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b> Now we find that treatment programs for
    juveniles do work - and were working all the while. This report, the initial
    publication of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's <i>
    What Works</i> series, describes a variety of successful prevention and
    treatment programs in the juvenile justice system. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Montgomeryetal1994">Montgomery,

 identified most of the following types of treatment or programs to which an
    adjudicated (juvenile) or convicted (adult) offender may be sentenced. Some
    or all of them
    may be available in your community and may be offered through youth-serving-
    or social service agencies. I've supplied a brief description of what
    each type of treatment or program may involve.</p>

    <p>Although the alternative sentence programs described above, and others like them,
    are
    more difficult to implement than simply tossing offenders in jail or prison, their ability
    to reduce gang activity and youth violence are potentially greater and more cost effective than
    incarceration. It should come as no surprise to hear that incarceration costs more than
    prevention or treatment due to the high cost of building and maintaining
    prisons, the annual cost of caring for its occupants, and the likely recidivism of the offender (committing
    additional crimes upon release from prison and having to be taken through
    the system again).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the average cost of
    incarceration for Federal inmates in 1999 was $21,926. State prison costs
    vary from about $18,000 to $60,000 per year depending upon the cost of
    living in the state in question and the amenities provided in the prison
    (medical prisons, for example, cost more to operate). Alternative sentences varying greatly in their cost depending upon the
    services rendered and the length of time the offender is in treatment. In
    some cases, offenders pay for all or a portion of their treatment expenses.</p>
    <p>We have a vested interest in having the courts incorporate as many alternative treatments and promising strategies for
    reducing youth violence as possible. Treatment outside the system is
    always preferred to treatment within it when the offenses are minor and
    the offender is not yet a threat to society. If gang activity and youth violence are not on the decline in your community, more
    community-based treatment programs may be needed for such offenders those
    already in existence may need to be expanded. Where risks for gang involvement are
    apparent <a href="../ISSUE/risk_protective.htm"> protective factors</a> need
    to be put in place.</p>
    <p>Probation and parole officers are among the justice practitioners who
    work with offenders on alternative sentences. The next topic deals with
    probation- and parole-related solutions.</p>
