      just an issue of law enforcement - it’s much more. It’s about creating

      <p align="left">As you may have noticed, I opened this part of the book
      with a quote which emphasizes the importance of a healthy
      family life for children and the need for preventing violence. The two go
      hand in hand and are part and parcel of the answer to what the health
      care community could do to reduce local gang activity and youth violence. While violence is the presenting problem (what we actually
      see), the underlying causes for the violence are the concern of mental health
      professionals. Therapies and programs which seek to remedy the causes of
      violence are our primary focus here.

    <p>The United States is not alone in the abuse of it's mothers. In 1994 &quot;Nearly
    three in ten Canadian women (29%) who have ever been married or lived in a
    common-law relationship have been physically or sexually assaulted by a
    marital partner at some point during the relationship; 21 % of these women
    were assaulted during pregnancy.&quot;<font size="1">  (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NCFVnodate">National
    Clearinghouse on Family Violence</a>)&nbsp;</font>
    Making matters worse, &quot;Children witnessed violence against their
    mothers in almost 40% of violent marriages; in many cases of children
    witnessing violence, the violence was so severe that the women feared for
    their lives (52%) and/or were injured (61 %).&quot; <font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NCFVnodate">National
    Clearinghouse on Family Violence</a>)&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p>The situation in England is no better. &quot;Domestic violence is the
    second most reported crime, accounting for about 25% of violent incidents
    reported to the police. Almost half of all murders of women are committed by
    their male partner. The British Medical Journal <font size="1">(Volume 311,
    January, 1995) </font>
    reported that women subjected to physical abuse are more likely to report
    mental health problems including anxiety, depression, and attempts at
    suicide.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.successunlimited.co.uk/bio.htm">Tim

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">What can the health care
    community do?</font></b></p>
    <p>The health care community includes both those who administer to
    our physical health and mental health. Most of our attention, however, will be
    on what mental
    health professionals (i.e., psychologists,
    psychiatrists, therapists, counselors) could do to reduce gang activity and youth
    violence.</p>
    <p align="left">Failing intervention and remediation by any other means
    (i.e., by other family members, members of the faith community), the health
    care community may intercede. It often does this as a result of court orders -
    orders given as a result of arrests, convictions, and conditions of formal
    or informal probation. Among the most effective interventions are those
    which address the need for family counseling, anger management, non-violent conflict
    resolution, and substance abuse withdrawal. Left untreated, any one of these
    problems may lead to continued spousal- and child abuse.
    </p>
    <p align="left">I am not a therapist. I
    have, however, worked with and interviewed psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, and
    counselors as well as many of their clients - gang members and non-members.
    From what I've learned, the solutions suggested in this Part of <i>Into the
    Abyss </i>appear to be effective strategies for
    reducing gang activity and youth violence seemingly related to violence
    experienced in one's home. According to Hollin <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Hollin1993">Hollin</a>,
    1993)</font>, some of the solutions are directed at the offending juvenile while
    others are directed at an entire social institution - such as the family,
    schools, the justice system, or community-based treatment programs.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2"> Individual programs can be subdivided
    into individual behavior therapy (reinforcement, punishment), social skills
    training, and cognitive-behavior modification (self-control and
    self-instruction, anger control, role-taking, social problem solving, moral
    reasoning development).&nbsp;In other types of programs, the focus is on change
    via an external agency such a residential institution or community program.
    The latter may consist of school-based intervention, family-based
    intervention (parent management training, functional family therapy),
    probation, or diversionary projects. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Hollin1993">Hollin</a>,

                While children are the first victims of the deterioration of
                family life, society suffers as well. Strengthening the ability

                priority. The influence of the family environment on the child's
                social development lasts a lifetime. Accordingly, effective
                delinquency prevention efforts must involve the family, and

            <p align="left">Physical harm often accompanies gang membership. Medical
            professionals in the health care community need to be aware of the
            various physical signs of gang affiliation and the possibility that,
            when not readily apparent, an individual's injuries may be
            gang-related. If they are, notification of the police may be in
            order. Hospital policy may be instructive in this regard. If,
            however, there is no policy for reported alleged gang-affiliation,
            policy may need to be developed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The detection of gang membership, as exhibited on one's body,
    may sometimes be difficult. Three
    small dots tattooed on the back of one's hand or ear or a tattoo of a five- or
    six-pointed star are possible indicators of gang membership as are thousands
    of others kinds of tattoos. There are other
    obvious and ominous signs of gang membership
    and gang-related violence such as bruises and cuts from beatings or sexual
    assaults related to gang initiation rites. Health care professionals should
    be trained to detect these signs so they can inform the community's efforts to reduce
    activity and youth violence.</p>

          <p align="left">&quot;There is no doubt that addressing the needs of
          children exposed to violence is initially expensive. Yet over the long
          term, these expenditures prove to be extremely cost effective. Being
          abused or neglected as a child increases the likelihood of arrest as a
          juvenile by 53 percent and of arrest for a violent crime as an adult
          by 38 percent. Therefore, preventing the violence or reducing its
          impact soon after it occurs means - at a minimum - saving the later
          costs of investigating, prosecuting, and rehabilitating juvenile and
          adult offenders who were child victims.
          <p align="left">Some prevention programs that have studied
          expenditures versus outcomes are confirming the cost effectiveness of
          early, high-quality efforts. For example, the Tender Loving Care Home
          Visitation program in Oakland, CA, documents that the cost of the
          program in governmental and societal services ($6,000 per family per
          year) is recovered by the newborn child’s fourth birthday and the
          projected cost savings over a child’s lifetime are four times the
          cost of the program.&quot; <font size="1">(OJJDP, November, 2000, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/summary_safefromstart/chap3.html#f">page</a>)</font></p>
