    associated with several gangs</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">They may form alliances with rival gangs 
    to carry out criminal activity, but their independent mode of operating 
    makes them difficult for law enforcement to classify. Thus, it is very 
    important for law enforcement agencies to recognize the diverse gang culture 
    of hybrid gangs, to approach them without any preconceived notions, and to 
    concentrate on their gang-related criminal activity rather than on their 
    presumed affiliations with traditional gangs. </font></b></p>
