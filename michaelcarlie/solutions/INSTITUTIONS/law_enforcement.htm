    <p align="left">When it comes to gangs, police are first responders - they
    are often the first justice system practitioners to encounter gang members. They
    encounter them as a result of a call for service from someone or because
    they see them while on patrol. Short of questioning, detaining (juveniles), arresting
    (adults), interrogating, or testifying against gang members, what do police
    do with or for them? As it ends up, they do a number of things. As mentioned
    in our discussion of <a href="../../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/tactics.htm#prevention">police
    tactics</a>, some police are involved in prevention and intervention with
    gang members or youths who look like they're headed in that direction.</p>
    <p align="left"> I
    also found some police departments who simply tried to sweep the gang
    situation under the carpet in hopes that it would go away.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Field Note:&nbsp;A Statistical
Solution to the Gang Situation</font><font color="#0000FF"><br>
The rumor that this town once had the highest concentration of gang members in the
United States is, according to all three gang unit members, not true. They explained that,
when the department scrambled to deal with the then new gang problem in the late 1980s, the original response was to deny there was a problem.
</font></font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">In time, the department had to acknowledge what everyone
else could
then clearly see - there were gangs. The department initiated a process of identifying who the gang members were.
The criteria used to accomplish
this were so broad that more people were included than perhaps should have been.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">Since that time the department has &quot;refined the criteria,&quot;
as I was told, and, using this new
definition, the number of documented gang members has been reduced. One of the most important changes was making a distinction between
&quot;active&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot; gang members. An inactive gang member is someone with
whom the police have had no interaction for two years.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">Later in the evening two of the gang unit members explained
that this was a somewhat
problematic distinction since, during those two years, the individual &quot; may
simply not have been caught doing illegal things or the individual may have been gang banging
in another city or state&quot; Given the high mobility rate of gang members,
this concern is real.</font></b></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;And the individual may have been in prison and could be gang banging
            there,&quot; one officer said. Another of the unit members expressed
            his concern that, due to the political flack
            kicked up by the presence of gangs, &quot;The new criteria being
            used were implemented to simply make it look like the problem was being reduced. It's all a matter of playing around with definitions
            and statistics ... the problem is still there. When the people of
            the community heard there were about 2,500 gang members in town [under
            the old definition] we heard 'You have to get that number down!'
            Of course, one way to do that is to manipulate the criteria being used.&quot;</font></b></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">While in the gang unit's office I asked where the
            gang member mug shots were.
            A gang unit member said &quot;The new Deputy Chief came in and told us to take
            'em down! No reason was given. The room is even secured, so we were the only ones who saw
            them! This is the same Deputy Chief who instigated the revamping of the criteria used
            to classify someone as a gang member.&quot;&nbsp;</font></b></p>

    <p>Several of the communities I visited had police departments which had 
    adopted a problem-oriented approach to policing. More often than not, the 
    approach was limited to one or two units within the police department, 
    rather than being an overarching orientation of the entire department. The 
    Juvenile Unit, Gang Unit, and Community-Oriented Policing Unit were most 
    likely to have a problem-oriented approach.</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font size="2" color="#008000">Problem-Oriented 
    Policing offers the police a model for addressing the underlying conditions

    </blockquote>

    <p>As opposed to the traditional incident-oriented approach of police (e.g., 
    a crime incident is reported to the police, the police respond, another 
    incident is reported, the police respond, etc.), the problem-oriented 
    approach involves at least nine distinct steps or phases. It is believed 
    that the problem-oriented approach is more effective than the 
    incident-oriented approach at reducing the underlying problems which are 
    causing crime to occur. The nine steps are as follows:</p>
