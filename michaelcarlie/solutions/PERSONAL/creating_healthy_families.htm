    An international gang researcher told me &quot;Adults haven't bothered to ask

    know what they need and we must know what those things are.&quot;</font></font></b></p>

    <p align="left">When friends and colleagues first learned I was going to
    spend my sabbatical studying gangs, they asked me
    why I was going to do that. &quot;After all,&quot; they said,
    &quot;isn't it the family's fault?&quot; They were referring to
    the oft-heard comment that &quot;bad&quot; kids, or kids who join gangs, are
    a product of dysfunctional families.</p>
    <p align="left"> I was prone to accepting that explanation back then, but I
    no longer accept it. After seeing the social environment in which many of
    the families I studied reside,
    I realized most gang youth come from families located in dysfunctional <i>neighborhoods</i>.
    Few families in such dysfunctional settings can avoid becoming dysfunctional -
    although some do. I
    learned it was more the dysfunctional <i> neighborhoods</i> that needed
    fixing than it was the families in them, although both need attention.</p>
    <p align="left">A neighborhood is dysfunctional if its residents live in fear. A
    neighborhood is dysfunctional if its playgrounds are the haunt of drug dealers
    and pimps. A neighborhood is dysfunctional if its schools have paint
    peeling off the walls, out-dated libraries, and teachers who are afraid to
    go to work.&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left"> A neighborhood is dysfunctional if its
    residents see no hope of gainful employment nor hope for a better life for themselves
    and their children. A neighborhood is dysfunctional if the social institutions
    which are supposed to make life full of meaning and bountiful are weak,
    absent, or in a state of denial.</p>
    <p align="left">I think it's possible that dysfunctional neighborhoods produce
    dysfunctional families, not the other way around. For this reason I believe
    gang activity and youth violence may be reduced by changing the neighborhood - by making its
    social institutions more responsive to the needs of local residents. Rebuilding
    the social institutions (i.e., school, faith, business, government, and
    families) will restore a sense of &quot;community&quot; and should reduce gang activity and youth violence.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">There's an analogy I like to use that is appropriate
    here. Have you ever heard some one ask &quot;What's the use of
    rehabilitating criminals in prison when we just send them right back
    to the neighborhoods from which they came and where crime is a way of
    life?&quot;&nbsp;Likewise, what sense is there in trying to rehabilitate a
    family when the environment in which that family lives is
    dysfunctional?&nbsp;Healthy families produce fewer delinquents and gang members
    than do families that are dysfunctional.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Healthy or functional families may
    be identified by exhibiting many different attributes. Among them are having
