    <p>&quot;Heroin trafficking is a major source of income for Asian gangs.
    Asian gangs also engage in extortion, armed robbery, and high tech crimes. The 14k triad is the largest triad worldwide. It was formed after the second
    world war by Nationalists fleeing Communist Chinese. The Kung Lok was
    founded in TO by Lau Wing Kui. The Kung Lok triad was involved in illegal
    gambling, and extortion.&quot; Reprinted here with permission of the author

    <p>Most commonly used to refer to people who &quot;hang&quot; with
    gang members. They are sometimes the friends or acquaintances of
    documented gang members.&nbsp;The gang manual for one police department I studied defines a gang associate
as &quot;a person who admits to criminal street gang association and either resides or frequents a particular street
gang's area and adopts their style of dress, use of hand signs or symbols, is identified as an
associate by a parent, guardian, or corroborated statement of the department or an informant, is identified as an associate by physical evidence such as
a photograph or other documentation or has been arrested more than once in the company of identified gang members for offenses consistent with criminal
street gang activity.&quot;</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b><a name="Core">Core</a> gang member</b></font></p>
    <p>Some gangs are large and diversified enough to have an identifiable
    structure. At the center one may find the leaders of the gang
    surrounded by the core members. The core members are the more
    criminally active and long-term members. Other positions in a
    gang may include &quot;<a href="#Associates">associates</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="#Wannabe">wannabes</a>,&quot; (for whom
    a better name may be &quot;gonnabes&quot;?). Gangs 101 provides <a href="../what_I_learned_about/gangs_101.htm">
    more information on gang structure</a>.</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b><a name="Documented gang member">Documented gang member</a></b></font></p>
    <p>A documented gang member is an individual who has been officially
    identified by law enforcement authorities as a gang member. An
    individual may be identified as a gang member through self-admission (verbal
    or through such identifiers as color of clothing, tattoos, etc.),
    identification by his or her associates, by an individual or individuals
    living in proximity of the gang member, or through law enforcement
    intelligence efforts.</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b><a name="Electronic">Electronic</a>
    socialization</b></font></p>
    <p>The process of socialization involves interaction and communication with
    other human beings through which an individual learns about his or her
    culture. The process begins at birth and may last for a
    lifetime. Learning about one's culture through the mass media,
    Internet, and other electronic forms of communication is referred to here as
    electronic socialization. Electronic socialization may occur without the presence of
    another living human being.</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Gang <a name="displacement">displacement</a></b></font></p>
    <p>Gang displacement occurs when community and/or law enforcement pressures
    are brought to bear on the members of a gang and they move their criminal
    activities to a different location.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Gang <a name="entrenchment">entrenchment</a></b></font></p>
    <p>Gang entrenchment occurs when a gang establishes a seemingly permanent
    presence in a given neighborhood. The culture of the neighborhood is
    the culture of the gang.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In its most complete form, gang entrenchment includes liaisons with area land owners and landlords, local
    businesses, police, probation and parole officers, prosecutors, local
    politicians, and public defenders. The liaison may be clandestine and
    passive (as when justice practitioners overlook &quot;minor&quot; violations
    of law such as minors in possession of alcohol or the use of marijuana) or
    blatant and aggressive.</p>

    <p>(Also referred to as &quot;gang-related&quot; or &quot;member-related.&quot;) A gang-related 
	or member-related crime is one in which a gang member is either the
    perpetrator or the victim or both, regardless of the motive.<font size="1"> (<i><a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/jjsum_11_00/survey8.html#gang">National
    Youth Gang Survey</a>, 1998)</i>&nbsp;</font> A member-related crime is a criminal act which is 
	<b><u>not</u></b> motivated by the alleged offender's gang
    but was, rather, an act committed for the sole satisfaction and benefit of the alleged
    offender.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The gang may not even have known about the act. Use of
    the &quot;member-related&quot; definition for statistical purposes will likely produce 
	<i>higher</i>
    numbers of gang crimes since <i>it is easier to show an individual is a
    member of a gang than to prove that the gang motivated the gang member to
    commit the crime</i>.</p>
    <p>The advantages of using the member-based definition include the tracking
    of all gang incidents, the increase in intelligence it provides, the numbers
    it generates may facilitate funding/grant opportunities, and it helps
    perpetuate and expand the efforts of anti-gang treatment programs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Gang motive-based crime refers to a criminal act committed by a known gang
    member on behalf of his or her gang rather than for the sole satisfaction or
    benefit of
    the alleged offender. Use of the &quot;gang-motivated&quot; definition
    for
    statistical purposes will likely produce lower numbers of gang crimes due to
    the difficulty in proving the offender is a gang member and that his illegal
    act was motivated by his or her gang.</p>
    <p>Among the advantages of using the motive-based definition are that it
    gives a more refined statistic, one that speaks directly to the influence of
    the gang on the criminal activities of its members. Among the
    disadvantages are that &quot;motive&quot; is often difficult to prove,
    some gang crimes may go unreported, and the lower statistics that it
    produces may foster a denial of the seriousness of the gang situation. <a href="../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/which_is_best.htm">Which

    Asian gangs are best known for committing this crime, it is also committed
    by other kinds of gangs and by non-gang offenders. The reason for waiting to

	<p>Due to their age, juveniles (&quot;minors&quot;) are viewed as
    incapable of taking care of themselves, therefore the juvenile court (judge)
    takes on the role of parents (&quot;paren&quot;) to determine the course of
    action which would be in the best interest or welfare of the child.</p>
    <p><b><a name="Parole"><font color="#0000FF">Parole</font></a></b></p>
    <p>Some convicted persons are sentenced to prison with no possibility of
    parole. Most convicted persons sentenced to prison, however, are
    allowed to be paroled as long as they behave well in prison. If they
    do behave well they may be given &quot;<a href="#Good time">good time</a>.&quot;
    A person placed on parole is one who is given a conditional early release
    from his or her prison sentence. While on parole the individual
    must, among other things, stay crime and drug free and report regularly to
    his or her parole officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Plea <a name="bargain">bargain</a></font></b></p>
    <p>In a plea bargain the accused offers to plead guilty in exchange for a
    concession from the state (the prosecutor). Among the many
    possible concession are lowering of the sentence, dropping of one or more
    charges, dropping felony charges while keeping misdemeanor charges, or the

    <p>A sentence given in lieu of a sentence to prison. A person on probation
    will be supervised in the community by a probation officer as long as
    specific conditions of that probation are satisfactorily fulfilled. If any
    one or more of the conditions are violated (i.e., committing a crime,
    carrying a weapon, failing to appear for treatment, failure to report to the

    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Prosecutorial <a name="merit">merit</a></font></b></p>
    <p>A case which, when brought to court, has a high probability of concluding

    prosecutorial merit. Cases which have less certain outcomes do not have
    prosecutorial merit.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Recidivism">Recidivism</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Recidivism, when used in the context of prisons, typically refers to the
    proportion of inmates who return to prison following their release from a
    prior period of incarceration. That is, if an inmate serves his
    time and receives a conditional early release (called parole) or is
    discharged (freed after serving a full sentence), commits a new offense, is
    convicted of it and given a new prison sentence, he has recidivated back to
    prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Prison recidivism rates vary widely from one state to another and depend
    upon the level of security (minimum, medium, or maximum) at which the inmate
    was held. Estimates of the nation-wide rate of recidivism varies from
    20% to 40% within the first 2 to 5 years from the date of release from the
    last incarceration. These are only estimates as few states know
    whether inmates they released ended up incarcerated in another state or
    changed names and ended up locked up in the same state under a new
    name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Saturation">Saturation</a> Policing</font></b></p>
    <p>Saturation policing involves the assignment of a great number of police 
    to a specific area. It may be used for special occasions (i.e., an event 
    that will bring protesters together, the presence of a dignitary or other 
    individual or group that is likely to attract criminal activity, a search 
    for a particular individual or individuals) or on a regular basis in 
    response to a known pattern of criminal activity over time. For example, if 
    criminal activity occurs with some regularity on Fridays in a certain park 
    over a period of several weeks, the police may begin saturating the park 
    area on Fridays to deter such activity as well as to make arrest when 
    possible.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you've heard of Bloods, Crips, People, or Folk. Those are
    the names of gangs and there are many &quot;sets&quot; (or <i>clikas</i> in
    Hispanic gangs) within each. In some communities there are dozens of Blood
    sets, Crip sets, and others. They are each typically named after a different
    local neighborhood, street, park, school, or valley. Although the set's' names may end with the word
    &quot;Blood,&quot; or &quot;Crip,&quot; it doesn't mean they know or
    work with one another. In fact, there may be bad relations
    between certain sets within the same gang name (Blood, Crip, etc.) The nature of the relationship between sets varies
    day to day within the same community and from community to community.&nbsp;</p>

    significant social institutions in any society are the family, faith,
    education, health care, government, commerce, the media, and the justice
    system.</p>
    <p>In the family, some of the <i>statuses</i> would be father, mother,
    child, brother, sister, uncle, etc. Each status has a variety of
    <i>
    roles</i> to play and the roles of each status vary from the other. In
    the faith community there are, for example, the statuses of minister and
    member of the congregation, each with its unique roles.&nbsp; The same
    principle applies in the other social institutions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Socialization">Socialization</a></font></b></p>
    <p>The process of social interaction and communication through which an individual
    comes to learn and internalize the culture of their society or group.
    Socialization takes place throughout a person's life but is especially
    intense from birth through childhood as we are socialized into society.
    Socialization continues, for example, as we learn how to do a job, behave in
    a marriage, act as a parent, and deal with retirement.</p>

    <p>Sociology is a behavioral science, and a sociologist is someone who
    studies social relations between people, people and groups, and between
    groups. Other areas of investigation include culture, social
    institutions, and social structures. The impact of the
    individual upon society and society's impact on the individual are also a
    topic of interest to sociologists.</p>
    <p>Since its inception in the 1800's, the study of sociology has expanded to
    include the field of criminology, gender studies, race and ethnic relations,
    social psychology, and many others. Visit the site of the <i>Sociology
    Dictionary</i> for <a href="http://www.webref.org/sociology/sociology.htm">an

    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Status">Status</a> offense</font></b></p>
    <p>Status offenses include underage drinking,
      truancy, curfew violations, incorrigibility, and running away. Status offenses would not be defined as crimes if committed by adults.
    The word &quot;status&quot; refers to the age of the offender. Status
    offenses are offenses only juveniles can commit.</p>
    <p><b><a name="Sweep"><font color="#0000FF">Sweep</font></a></b></p>
    <p>A sweep takes place when law enforcement officials, usually with arrest 
	and search warrants in hand, enter a neighborhood with the intent to serve 
	all the arrest warrants (make arrests) and search warrants (conduct 
	searches). This law enforcement technique is often used when making arrests 
	of a large number of alleged drug-related offenders, prostitution or theft 
	rings, and other large-scale criminal operations.</p>
	<p>The following story comes from Katz's and Webb's research on the police 
	gang unit in Las Vegas (NV).</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>In Las Vegas, gang unit officers used a much more 
		aggressive strategy that many of them referred to as a <i>sweep</i>. The 
		members of each gang enforcement squad worked as a team. The team would 
		split into four pairs, each assigned to its own squad car. </b></font>
		</p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>At the beginning of the shift, the team would agree 
		on the areas they were going to sweep and the order in which sweeps 
		would be conducted. To begin, generally all four vehicles would rally at 
		a single point outside the specified neighborhood. From there, one pair 
		of officers would patrol down the 'hot street' - a street or area where 
		gang members were know to loiter or conduct street-level drug sales. Two 
		other pairs in squad cars would patrol the two streets immediately 
		parallel to the hot street, keeping pace with he lead car.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>The forth squad car would remain out of sight at 
		the end of the street, slowly patrolling toward the other three. This 
		tactic involved squeezing gang members toward the center of the targeted 
		area. Then if a suspect fled on foot or in a vehicle, one of the squad 
		cars would be in position to pursue and stop that person. </b></font> <font size="1">(<a href="bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz

    <p>In sentencing an offender to a period of time in jail or prison, a judge,
    at his or her discretion, may deduct from the sentence the length of time
    the offender spent in jail awaiting his or her trial. For example, if a
    suspect spent one month in jail awaiting trial and was sentenced to six
    months in jail for his offense, the judge may conclude pronouncement of the
    sentence saying &quot;Six months less time served.&quot; In this case, the
    offender has only five months to serve in jail before he is discharged and
    set free.</p>

    <p>A policy of zero tolerance means police will not tolerate the
    violation of any law. The purpose of a zero tolerance policy is to
    enhance opportunities for temporarily denying suspects of their freedom so
    that  police can find out who they are, why they are where they are, what
    they're doing or intending on doing, and to run their driver license number
    (or name, or vehicle license plate number) through a police database to
    determine if the suspect is wanted or should, for some other reason, be
    held.</p>
