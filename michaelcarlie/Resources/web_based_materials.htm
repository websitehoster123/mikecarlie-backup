<blockquote>
	<p><b><font size="2">This handbook provides information about gangs for 
	education professionals working with immigrants. As the introduction makes 
	clear, gangs are one of the many problems that newly arrived immigrants face 
	in their neighborhoods and at school in the United States. Following the 
	introduction, the first section describes the types of gangs including 
	social gangs, delinquent gangs, and violent gangs. </font></b></p>
	<p><b><font size="2">The second section 
	explains gang ethnicity for the following groups: (1) Latino gangs; (2) 
	Black gangs; (3) predominantly White gangs; and (4) Asian gangs. The third 
	section lists and discusses reasons for gang membership, which include 
	identity, protection, fellowship, and intimidation. A general profile of 
	gang-related youth lists family, personal, community, and school related 
	indicators. </font></b></p>
	<p><b><font size="2">Examples of gang activities are described, including 
	drive-by-shootings, graffiti, robbery and aggravated assault, and drug use. 
	A chart that is designed to show youth the long-term negative educational 
	and life consequences of gang membership is presented. Also listed are ways 
	teachers can help, gang slang with &quot;translation,&quot; common gang hand-signs, 
	and selected community resources.</font></b></p>

in Schools</a></font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <b><font size="2">&quot;Despite their high profile in the media, relatively
  few young people join gangs; even in highly impacted areas, the degree of
  participation has rarely exceeded 10 percent. In addition, it has been
  reported that less than 2 percent of all juvenile crime is gang-related.</font></b>
  <p><b><font size="2">&quot;Such low numbers, however, may camouflage the
  impact that the presence of gangs has on a school. For one thing, they play a
  significant role in the widespread increase of violence in the schools;
  indeed, school violence has steadily increased since a 1978 National Institute
  of Education study, Violent Schools-Safe Schools, found that school-aged
  children were at a higher risk of suffering from violence in school than
  anywhere else.&quot;</font></b></p>

	characteristics. </font></b></p>

	Chapter 4, &quot;Ethnic Gangs,&quot; reviews the formation of gangs based on ethnicity 
	and highlights the role of the school in educating potential gang members. 
	Chapter 5, &quot;Gang Violence,&quot; outlines the nature and sources of gang violence 
	and its diversity of expression and suggests its impact on society at large. 
	Chapter 6 begins the discussion of effective intervention by considering 
	&quot;Desirable Program Characteristics.&quot; </font></b></p>
	<p><b><font size="2">In chapter 7, &quot;Controlling the School 
	Environment,&quot; school responses to the gang presence, including facilities

	and Community Enrichment Solutions,&quot; focuses on enrichment as a supplement

<blockquote>
	<p><b><font size="2">A common misconception about gangs is that they 
	resemble past images of motorcycle riders. Society is now faced with what 
	are called &quot;hybrid&quot; gangs whose members are usually 14 to 16 years of age, 
	who dress conservatively, who display subtle gang identifiers, and who are 
	motivated by a combination of profit and poor family life. This booklet 
	contains information to help teachers identify gang members and gang 
	activities on their campus. The first step to solving gang problems is to be 
	aware that they do exist. Teachers are essential to gang intervention and 
	prevention because of the amount of time children spend in the classroom 
	each day. Some of these students can be saved from a life of crime if they 
	are diverted from gang activities at an early age. Some of the topics 
	covered in this booklet are definitions; types of gangs; gang awareness in 
	the classroom; gang attire, tattoos, graffiti, and hand signals; and 
	language. Further discussion is offered on why kids join gangs and the 
	various types of gangs present in society, such as delinquent youth-gangs, 
	traditional turf-based gangs, gain-oriented gangs, and violent/hate gangs. 
	Finally, suggestions are given as to what schools can do to limit gang 
	activities. (See the
