    Justice System</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/legislature.htm">Gang-Related Legislation</a></font></b></p>
    <p>In addition to using existing laws to suppress gang activity, legislation at
    municipal, state, and federal levels has expanded to
    address the growing gang situation in the United States. Enhancements to
    various laws have increased potential punishments for their violators and
    new laws have been passed which identify, include, and criminalize gang-related
    activities (i.e. graffiti, gang recruitment).</p>
    <p>It is difficult to tell if this approach has been successful in reducing
    gang activity. Of concern is the net impact of lengthy prison
    sentences which cause gang members to be thrown together in prison for years
    without effective treatment. There is, rather, a concern that incarceration may accelerate gang
    activity as gang members are
    released from prison and reenter their old neighborhoods.</p>
    <p>Perhaps one of the greatest shortcomings of state legislatures is their
    failure to recognize the role of juveniles in gang formation and gang
    activity. Absenting juveniles from gang-related legislation has
    handicapped the justice system and continues to threaten communities which, as
    a result, are left to face juvenile gang members with few legal tools at
    their command in on order to restrict their behavior.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>A review of Katz's and Webb's research on four American gang units 
		revealed that the police gang units studied exhibited an absence of 
		control and accountability over their officers.
		<font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">At three of the four 
		research sites the researchers found a lack of gang-unit-specific 
		&quot;policies, procedures, or rules guiding officer behavior, and the few 
		policies and procedures that did exist were modest in scope and nature.&quot;
		<font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
		and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; x)&nbsp; </font>As if to compound matters and 
		make them worse, the researchers found that &quot;the gang units ... lacked 
		adequate performance measures ... and were hard pressed to offer 
		specific evidence of the units' effectiveness.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
		and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; x)</font> </font></p>
		<p><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The also found that 
		gathering and collecting intelligence was the principal commodity 
		produced by the gang units studied and consumed most of their working 
		time. Interestingly, they found that &quot;almost no one ... believed that 
		gang unit suppression efforts were effective at reducing the 
		communities' gang problems.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
		and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; xii)</font></font></p>
		<p><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The gang units were 
		decoupled (disconnected both organizationally and strategically) from the 
		remainder of their respective police agencies. &quot;This resulted in several 
		negative consequences, limiting the capacity and effectiveness of the 
		units.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
		and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; xiii) </font>The researchers found that the 
		decoupling of the gang units from the rest of the police organization 
		led gang unit officers to isolate themselves from the rest of the 
		department and from the community. It reduced the unit's ability to 
		provide needed information and to receive information from other units 
		in the department.</font></p>
		<p>Finally, Katz and Webb also found the gang units studied did not 
		practice community-oriented policing. Instead, they were, in many ways, 
		isolated from the neighborhoods they served. Contact with everyday 
		citizens were rare.</p>

            Response to Gangs</a></font></b>
            <p align="left">Police departments may be characterized as passing
            through several phases on their way to having effective anti-gang activity measures. The steps, in order, include
            denial, acknowledgement, study, planning, implementation, and
            evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">Denial is a barrier to effective action and
            may be the result of many forces acting upon the police. But,
            once the gang situation is acknowledged and information
            is gathered concerning its
            nature and extent, it is possible to devise plans to reduce gang
            activity.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">Police recognize that
            arrests alone will not reduce gang activity to acceptable levels.
            The entire community, and its various social institutions, must be
            involved for this to occur.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/located.htm">Where is the Gang Unit Located?</a></font></b></p>
            <p>Where a gang unit is located within a law enforcement organization
            will determine what gang members are arrested for and, as a
            result, the perception the community has regarding its gangs. If the
            gang unit is located in the juvenile
            division, gang members are perceived of as troubled youth. If it is located in
            narcotics, gang members are viewed as substance abusers and the gang
            &quot;problem&quot; is drugs.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A community's approach to reducing gang activity is typically
            based upon its perception of what the problem is. Clearly, the
            location of the gang unit is critical if a accurate perception of
            the &quot;problem&quot; is to be found.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/purpose.htm">The Purpose of a Gang Unit</a></font></b></p>
            <p>There are four possible stances one could take regarding
            gangs. The first is <i><b>denial</b></i> - &quot;There are no
            gangs in my community.&quot; The second is to acknowledge a gang
            presence and try to <i><b>prevent</b></i> non-gang members from
            joining one. The third is an attempt to <i><b>intervene</b></i> with
            gang members in an effort to bring them out of the gang. Finally,
            one may act to <i><b>suppress</b></i> gang activity by
            arresting and convicting gang members.</p>
            <p>The purpose of a gang unit is to suppress gang activity. This is
            typically accomplished by gathering intelligence on gang
            members, conducting investigations of known criminal activity, and making arrests. Most police I encountered openly acknowledged that suppression 
			(arrest and conviction) alone will not solve a
            community's gang situation. People who work in the corrections stage 
			(i.e., probation/parole, institutionalization, etc.) must offer 
			effective treatment programs following suppression. </p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/training.htm"> Training
            a Gang Unit</a></font></b></p>
            <p>My&nbsp; limited observations suggest that police training
            curricula omit information about community-based prevention and
            intervention efforts. While this is understandable in the context of
            their primarily suppressive function, where prevention or
            intervention efforts might be beneficial, police are left unaware of
            what their respective communities provide.</p>
            <p>What I did learn is that there are important questions which must
            be answered if police are to be adequately prepared to deal with the
            gang situation in their community. Included are: Does police academy
            training include content on street gangs? Does the police academy
            include a sufficient amount of material on gangs? Are newly assigned
            gang unit officers provided training? Are existing gang unit
            officers offered on-going training? Are police personnel outside the
            gang unit provided training on gangs? If training is offered, who
            provides it?</p>
            <p>As evidenced by the departments I visited, there is little on-going
            training for officers working gangs.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/tactics.htm">Tactics
            of a Police Gang Unit</a></font></b></p>
            <p>Tactics used by police gang officers or gang units include
            prevention and intervention but primarily consist of suppressive
            efforts. Some are designed to deter gang activity
            while others are designed to gather intelligence or arrest
            offenders.</p>
            <p>Collaboration and cooperation within and between
            law enforcement agencies appears to be increasing as is collaboration and
            cooperation between law enforcement agencies and community-based task
            force groups. These community-wide task force groups, while
            unproven in their impact on gang activity, do provide a forum within
            which police may establish contacts in the community (outside of law
            enforcement) and through which the public may learn more about the
            local gang situation.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/perceptions_of_gangs.htm">Police Perceptions of the Gang Situation</a></font></b></p>
            <p>Although their perceptions of the gang situation are influenced by
            personal experience with gang members and their parents or
            guardians, police have a realistic view of the situation in
            the community's they serve. I believe they have accurately identified poor parenting and lack
            of parenting skills as a major contributor to delinquency and gang involvement. They also recognize the role the
            community plays in creating an environment which is <i> not</i> family
            friendly (i.e., poor schools, lack of employment, racism and
            discrimination).</p>
            <p>Some police stereotype gang members and, as a result,
            are likely to include among them youths who are not gang members.
            They may associate with youths who are gang members, but they do not commit crimes nor identify themselves
            as part of &quot;the gang.&quot; I understand why some police stereotype them (it's easier
            and after a while they all
            start to look the same).&nbsp; But it results in errors in judgment
            and children's futures are at stake.</p>

            System&quot;</a></font></b></p>
            <p>The police observed for this study shared a disdain for the
            very system of justice of which they are an integral part. Laws were
            viewed as difficult to enforce, prosecutors as playing a
            game in which winning and efficiency are paramount, judges as blind to the
            gang situation, and juvenile courts emasculated when it comes to dealing with gang members
            who are minors.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/POLICE/difficulties.htm">Difficulties
            Related to Working Gangs</a></font></b></p>
            <p>There are many difficulties faced by police when dealing with
            gangs. Among them are those within their own agency and include a) internecine competition between officers and units,
            b) poor communication between patrol officers and gang
            unit officers, c) the requirement that, upon promotion, officers be moved out of their units, d) the shifts during which the gang unit
            works, and e) evaluating the effectiveness of the police gang unit
            or gang officer.<p>Other
            difficulties arise when a gang unit in one department attempts to
            work with another law enforcement agency. Some departments are
            unwilling to participate in a collaborative
            effort for fear of having their turf invaded by another agency.<p>Difficulties also
            arise from having limited resources with which to respond
            effectively to the gang situation. Among the
            resources in short supply are personnel (gang units which are too
            small for the situation they face), funding for communications
            equipment and databases, and a shortage of community-based
            prevention and intervention programs to which police may refer some
            of the gang members they encounter.<p>The
            danger police face in working gangs and the impact of local politics
            on the gang unit's efforts are additional difficulties. Gangs present the police with
            certain problems including the clandestine and devious nature of
            their activity, constant lying, and movement within and between
            communities.<p>The cultural and language barriers which exist
            between police and gang members from various ethnic groups also
            complicates the work of police gang units. In some situations, the
            gang unit is dealing with cultural clashes between gangs
            rather than with more traditional criminal gang activity.

            the Line&quot;</a></font></b><p>Seeing how some gang unit officers

            of the most interesting and disturbing parts of my
            research.&nbsp;It was interesting because it provided me
            with real life examples of how police interaction towards gang
            members on the street impacts the way in which gang members
            relate, or fail to relate, to police. It was disturbing because it
            showed the &quot;other side&quot; of some police - the side that is
            rude, impatient, unnecessarily violent, and criminal.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/prosecutors.htm">Prosecutors, Courts, and &quot;The System&quot;</a></font></b></p>
    <p> In an effort to deal
    efficiently and effectively with gangs, prosecutors across the country are
    expanding their vertical prosecution model by creating specialized gang
    units to prosecute alleged gang members.</p>
    <p>Some prosecutors have enhanced their operations by proactively dealing
    with the gang situation in their respective communities. They work
    with police on the street gathering information from witnesses to alleged
    gang activity.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Prosecutors and the courts face a number of difficulties related to gangs
    including,
    but not limited to, police mismanagement of cases and problems related to out-of-date juvenile codes.
    Prosecutors (and police, for that matter) have had their hands
    tied when it comes to serious juvenile offending. Prosecutors are restricted
    from viewing the records of juvenile offenders and certification procedures
    for waiving juvenile offenders to criminal court are technically difficult, time
    consuming, and depend, in most cases, on a judge's decision.</p>
    <p>The American juvenile- and criminal-justice systems are
    struggling to deal with the gang phenomenon. The juvenile justice
    system still operates as though youths are &quot;kids&quot; - those sweet,
    innocent little creatures who just need a little attention to divert them
    from wrongdoing. The reality of the situation, particularly among
    juvenile gang members, has nothing to do with that stereotype.</p>
    <p>There are prosecutors who care a great deal about children and who would
    like to support any effort to get them help rather than prosecute and
    incarcerate them. A
    shortage of police and community-based prevention and intervention programs
    frustrate that goal.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Judges appear removed from the reality of the streets and gangs and,
    according to the prosecutors, police, and probation/parole officers I
    interviewed, often hand out inappropriate sentences. Judges, too, are often left without
    recourse to incarceration due to a lack of meaningful
    alternative treatments in the community.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Probation is a sentence in lieu of incarceration whereas someone
            on parole received a conditional early release from prison. One may think probationers are less serious
            offenders than parolees because they didn't get a prison sentence.
            The fact is that many offenders have been through the system
            several times so some probationers have served one or more
            prison terms before they were sentenced to probation for a new
            offense.</p>
            <p>The conditions of probation and parole are similar and extensive,
            although observations in the field suggest several of them can be
            violated without serious repercussions. In addition to standard
            conditions of probation and parole, gang members may have special
            conditions imposed.</p>
            <p>In all cases, probation or parole may be revoked if the violation
            of one or more conditions is sufficiently egregious.</p>

            <p>For the most part, probation and parole officers today act as brokers

            the communities which offer social services to prevent or
            intervene in their clients' gang involvement. In order to do this, probation and parole officers must know which of their clients
            are gang members which programs are
            available in the community to help them. Probation officers who have
            a caseload of gang clients should receive special training in order
            to acquire this knowledge.<p>Probation and parole
            officers may or may not be assigned a gang case load. Even
            though police and prosecutors may both have special units to deal
            with gang members, there is no requirement that a probation and
            parole office similarly organize its efforts. I believe this is a mistake.<p>Among the greatest needs of
            most gang-member-clientele are help with anger management,
            counseling for their prior abuse,
            substance abuse intervention, education, job
            training, job placement, and housing assistance. For both male and female gang members I
            would
            add sex education, family planning, and parenting classes.&nbsp;<p>At least three ingredients are needed in order
            to successfully treat gang- and non-gang members who are on probation or parole: the
            community must be sufficiently concerned to provide adequate treatment
            services, probation and parole officers must know which services are
            available, and offenders must be motivated to change their behavior.</p>
            <p>In addition to simply &quot;being there&quot; for their gang
            clientele, probation and parole officers sometimes provide in-house
            intervention programs. In addition, electronic monitoring
            (house arrest), home visits, and the imposition of &quot;conditions
            of probation and parole&quot; are designed to limit their clients'
            gang-related activity.<p> I
            found little evidence of an evaluation process for determining whether the efforts of probation and parole officers to
            reduce gang formation, gang joining, or criminal gang activity were effective.&nbsp;The
            same was true for the efforts of police, prosecutors, judges, and
            jail/prison administrators.

            &quot;Typical&quot; Morning of Office Visit</a></b><p>While some
            probation and parole officers may have a less harried schedule, the
            officers I visited typically were pressed for time during office
            visits with their clients due to having too many clients, too
            few resources for dealing with them, and too many other obligations
            (i.e., attending court, writing pre-sentence investigation reports,
            endless paperwork, participating in other work-related community
            activities).

            and parole officers are both police and social workers. This
            schizophrenic situation complicates their relationship with gang members (and
            other clientele). It requires the presentation
            of two entirely different personas and leaves clients feeling
            suspicious and distrustful.<p>Case overload, poor pay, limited
            training, and poor management by their supervisors
            contribute to the difficulties of being a probation and parole
            officer. Working with fellow officers who have little knowledge of
            gangs and problems inherent to working with gang members also
            presents a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The lack of throughcare for gang
            members is an undesirable situation. Structure and consistency
            is what was missing in many gang members' lives and failure to
            provide them while under the supervision of the court is unfortunate.<p>The
            relationships I witnessed between police gang unit personnel and probation and
            parole officers was, in many instances, poor. Police withheld information about
            gangs and gang members often leaving
            probation and parole officers in the blind.&nbsp;If the gang-member-client was an adult, probation and parole officers
            seemed open with police about their cases. When clients were
            juveniles, however, information did not flow as freely, much to the
            chagrin of the police.<p>Additional difficulties were
            encountered by probation and parole officers if the communities in
            which they worked were either in denial about gangs or were stingy
            about supporting community-based prevent and intervention programs.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

    Community-Based Treatment Programs</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Psychological counseling for gang members may be beneficial, it all
    depends upon the level of motivation of the gang member and the expertise of
    the counselor. Issues typically
    found bound together in these offenders include their membership in a dysfunctional
    family, substance abuse, child abuse, low self-esteem, and barriers
    between the client and therapist as a result of gang loyalty or other gang
    influences.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, most communities included in this study did have
    community-based social services designed to help at-risk youth. Their
    funding, however, was often insufficient and unstable, staff were poorly paid, and
    their client base was too large to allow for much individual attention,
    although agency personnel thought individual attention was important to
    offer.</p>
    <p>The reality of the matter is that the consequences of child abuse and
    substance abuse are difficult to overcome. Treatment may be long-term and
    expensive, and this client population (gang members) has neither spare time nor money. What
    time and money they do have is dedicated to working, paying bills, and who
    knows what else.</p>
    <p>I was struck by the dedication of many probation and parole officers and
    the people who worked in community-based social service agencies. The
    situation they face, however, often takes its toll in burnout.</p>
    <p>I don't know if things are going to get better, stay the same, or get
    worse. That's the next topic.</p>
