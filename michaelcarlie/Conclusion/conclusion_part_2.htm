            is a &quot;Gang?&quot;</a></font></b></p>
            <p>There is no one accepted definition of a gang and the definitions
            which currently exist vary widely. Were there one common definition, I propose it to be as follows:
            <b> a group of
            two or more individuals who share an on-going relationship and support one other individually or
    collectively in the recurring commission of delinquent and/or criminal behavior.</b></p>
            <p>That definition is broad enough to capture any size group which
            promotes delinquency and criminality yet specific enough to be
            useful in court. The broadest definition possible is needed in
            order to intervene with deviant gang youth at an early age.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/who_is_a_gang_member.htm">Who is a Gang Member?</a></font></b></p>
            <p>Any child may become a member of a gang. A gang member is defined,
            minimally, as anyone who thinks he or she is a gang member. However,
            youths who are labeled by others as gang members but who do not
            socialize
            with people who are breaking the law are not gang
            members.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Police labeling of a youth as a gang member may have the greatest
            impact of all in terms of how our system of justice views a
            given youth. In some cases, if labeling theory is correct, a
            youth who is defined and treated as a gang member by the police may,
            over time, accept that definition of him- or herself.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there are youths who claim to be members of a
            gang, who associate with other known gang members, and who
            participate in illegal activities with or on behalf of the gang.
            They are gang members, regardless of whether any individual act of
            criminality they commit was committed for personal reasons or
            gang-related reasons.</p>
            <p> There are formal
            mechanisms for determining gang membership which may or may not
            involve an initiation ceremony.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000">Demographic Characteristics of American
            Gangs</font></b></p>
            <p>Statistics on gangs and their members are inherently inaccurate.</p>
            <blockquote>
    <p><b><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/demographics_number.htm"><font color="#800000">The Number of Gangs and Gang Members</font></a></b></p>
    <p>As of the last official count (1999), there were approximately 840,500
    known gang members in the United States in 26,000 gangs. The number of cities and counties reporting the presence of gangs
            is increasing. While the <i> number of gangs</i> may have shown a
            slight decline in the recent past, the number of people who are joining gangs has been growing over the past
            two decades and shows no sign of declining.</p>
            <p>While the
            number of gang members found in rural and suburban areas increases
            and decreases from one year to the next, it is important to note that gangs are no longer an
            exclusive inner-city phenomenon. They, and
            their members, are now found across the entire landscape the
            United States and in other countries around the world.</p>
            <p><b><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/age_composition.htm"><font color="#800000">The
            Age and Social Class Composition of Gangs</font></a></b></p>
    <p>The proportion gang members who are adults (over 18 years of age for
    statistical purposes)
            has been increasing over the past several years. This is due, in part, to the
            increasingly difficult task of making the leap from gang
            activity to legitimate employment. It may also be due to the
            economic support gang activity may provide, the need for
            maintaining social contacts within the gang, and the individual gang
    member's affinity
            for all types of gang-related activity.</p>
    <p>The proportion of gang members who are under 15 years of age has
            also been increasing. Young boys and girls continue to be recruited into gangs
            because they may escape serious punishment if caught in gang-related behavior due to their status
            as juveniles.&nbsp;They are also
            recruited in order to increase the size of the gang and/or to
            replace the loss of older gang members to injury, death,
            incarceration, and migration away from the gang.</p>
    <p>In a recent survey, it was found that one-half of gang members
            are from the underclass - the class below the lower class. Gangs'
    presence in large public housing projects and their
            comparative absence in wealthier settings suggests more gang members
            are poor
            than are from the middle- or upper-class. The survey found no gang
            members identified as having come from upper-class
            environments.&nbsp;That may or may not be accurate.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/gender_composition.htm"><font color="#800000">The Gender
    Composition of Gangs</font></a></b></p>
            <p>While gangs have been and remain male-dominated, the increasing
            presence of females is clear. Estimates of female gang
            affiliation ranging from 8 percent to 38 percent are alarming. The
            implications for the children they bear is equally disturbing.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The proportion of gang members who are male or female varies from
            community to community and may also vary between neighborhoods
            within the same community.</p>
    <p>The majority of known female gang members, while not as violent as
            their male counterparts, are involved in assaults and other violent
            behavior. They are becoming more like male delinquents as concerns
    the types of crimes they commit.</p>
    <p><b><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/racial_composition.htm"><font color="#800000">The
    Racial
            and Ethnic Composition of Gangs</font></a></b></p>
            <p>Although the majority of known gang members in the United States
            are of Hispanic descent, it appears many, if not all, racial and ethnic groups are represented in
            the gang
    population. Given their rate of birth and the impact of social
            discrimination against them, it is conceivable that the proportion
            of Hispanics in the gang population may rise.</p>
    <p>Historically speaking and today, gang members in the United States are from the most
    marginalized groups in the society - either newly immigrating groups or
    other racial or ethnic groups which have not been fully accepted by Caucasians.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Some gangs are nearly exclusive in their ethnic or racial composition while
            others are a mix of several different ethnicities and races. This, too,
            is not a static situation and changes from time to time and from one
            community to another.</p>

            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/they_are_not_new.htm">Gangs Aren't New</a></font></b></p>
            <p>Gangs have been with us for
            centuries.&nbsp;They are not necessarily a
            sign of decay and doom. Rather, they are a normal, albeit problematic,
            part of many societies and may be symptomatic of other problems.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/kinds_of_gangs.htm">Kinds and Names of Gangs</a></font></b></p>
            <p>The diversity in the kinds of gangs there are hints at the complexity
            of the gang phenomenon which includes gangs with no single ideology or belief system
            (youth- or street gangs) as well as those <a href="../Resources/other_kinds_of_gangs.htm"> with an ideology</a> (i.e.,
            Skinheads, Aryan Brotherhood, Ku Klux Klan, Nation of Islam).&nbsp;</p>
            <p> There are drug-selling gangs, street gangs, and turf-based neighborhood
            gangs as well as short-lived gangs and gangs which that have been
            around for generations.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> Gangs' names may symbolize a feature in their neighborhood
            (i.e., the name of a street, park, or valley) or any one of a dozen other things
            and their names may change from time to time.</p>
            <p>Supposed &quot;nations&quot; of gangs (i.e., Crips, Bloods,
            People, Folk) are, in fact, not nations. They are, instead, a
            collection of &quot;sets,&quot; local groupings of gang youth who use the name
            &quot;Crip,&quot; for example, in their name but add a local
            identifier such as &quot;14th Street.&quot; Thus, &quot;14th Street
            Crips&quot; identifies the gang as a
            set within the supposed Crip nation.</p>
            <p>But the 14th Street Crips may not know any of
            the Crips in other local Crip sets, let alone Crips in other cities
            or countries. There are thousands of sets of gangs and precious few are organized
            to coordinate their activities with the activities of other sets. In fact, they are
            often at odds with other sets, even within their own
            &quot;nation.&quot;</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/culture.htm">The
            Gang Culture</a></font></b></p>
            <p>Gangs are a society within society, complete with their own subculture. Perhaps the most difficult barrier to overcome in dealing
            effectively with gang members is the influence of the subculture to which they
            belong. It is a subculture separate from but squarely rooted in our
            own. It thrives and preys upon the culture you and I think of
            as American society, but, depending upon their level of affiliation
            with a gang, their members have little regard or respect for it
            except for its emphasis on making money.</p>
            <p>The gang subculture serves a number of purposes - it is
            functional and, as such, important to its members. Some
            of them will die for it, if need be. Others will kill for
            it.</p>
            <p>To reduce the attractiveness of the gang subculture requires substituting other
            structures which will meet the same needs the gang subculture fulfills.
            That is, if we want to keep youths from joining gangs, we must offer
            legitimate structures through which their needs for security, power,
            respect, income, etc., can be met.&nbsp;Understanding gang members as members of another or different
            culture may assist in efforts to draw peripheral members away from the
            gang culture and to dissuade non-members from joining it.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/structure_of_gangs.htm">The Structure of Gangs</a></font></b></p>
            <p>There is considerable variation in the structure of gangs. Some
            researchers suggest a gang must be well organized in order to
            be called a gang. I
            learned that it is misleading, however, to view a loosely organized
            yet ongoing group of youths who knowingly
            support one another in the recurring commission of criminal acts as &quot;not
            really a gang. It's just a bunch of kids acting
            out.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they are a gang.</p>
            <p>The level of organization or structure of a gang has little to do with being
            part of the gang subculture and acting in ways that are socially
            repugnant and vile. When a youth joins a gang, regardless of
            its degree of structure or organization, he or she has left the fold and is a
            danger to him- or herself and everyone else in the community.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm">Why Gangs Form</a></font></b></p>
            <p>In order to join a gang, it must exist. The important question,
            then, is Why do gangs form? I consider this the question we should
            focus on rather than on why some youths join gangs. It moves our
            attention from the youth who join to the causes of gang formation in the
            first place.</p>
            <p>There are physiological, psychological,
            and social/cultural reasons why gangs form and, therefore, why certain youths
            join them. Maslow tells us that, until an individual's lower level physiological and safety needs are met,
            his or her higher level needs for
            belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization may not be achieved. It is rare to find a gang member who comes from an
            environment in which the these lower level needs are being fulfilled
            by the social institutions in the community (i.e., family, faith, school,
            and commerce), let alone many of the higher level needs.</p>
            <p>Were I to summarize what I learned about why gangs form it would
            be that there is no one satisfactory explanation. When, however, one
            takes into account the impact of a variety of factors - <a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/social_discrimination.htm">social

            <p>As compared to non-gang delinquents, gang members are more
            violent and a greater danger to society regardless of their age,
            gender, or race. They murder thousands of Americans every year - gang
            members and innocent bystanders alike.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The crimes gang members commit are, in large part, the same as those
            committed by non-gang offenders. They vary in that some crimes
            require the cooperation of other offenders (as in drug- or theft
            rings) and in the nature of intra- and inter gang
            rivalries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In many communities, gang members are responsible for a disproportionate amount of
            the delinquency and crime committed by juveniles. Focusing
            prevention, intervention, and suppression (enforcement) efforts on gang members will do more to reduce a community's delinquency
            and crime rates than would focusing on non-gang member delinquents.</p>

            and Gang Members</a></font></b></p>
            <p>The world of gangs is ever changing. People join them and leave them.
            Some join
            one gang then quit and join another. Gang members stay in one place
            and they move to other locations. In other words, they are an elusive population at best.</p>
            <p>Their internal leadership may change as may their size,
            composition, and the types of offenses they commit. They can dominate in some
            neighborhoods for a time then disappear.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
            The migration of gang members within communities and from one
            community to another represents a serious and growing threat to the quality of
            life in neighborhoods throughout the country.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Gang members use a variety of ways in which to identify
            themselves to one another and to outsiders including, but not limited to, tattoos,
            wearing certain kinds or colors of clothing or accessories, and the use
            of graffiti and hand signs. Older and more experienced gang members may avoid
            identification in order to avoid detection by police and
            rival gang members. Wannabes, on the other hand, may boldly
            exhibit gang identifiers in hopes of being recognized as a gangster.</p>

            <p>A gang member's life expectancy may be short and membership in
            a gang may also be for short periods of time. While some gang members
            remain members until they die, many leave their gang within
            one to two years.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Getting out of a gang does not always mean being harmed,
            although this can and does happen to some who attempt to leave. Intervention efforts are aimed at existing gang-affiliated youth
            and are complicated by potential threats of harm if someone wants to
            leave the gang.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/prisons.htm">Gangs and Prisons</a></font></b></p>
    <p>One of my greatest concerns, shared by
    gang researchers, police, and social service providers, is about gangs in the future is prison
    gangs. With nearly 600,000 prisoners being released from prison each
    year - many of whom are gang-affiliated - it won't take long before the worst
    aspects of prison culture become fully integrated into gang culture on the
    streets of our neighborhoods.</p>
    <p>The walls of America's prisons are permeable. Inmates come and go in a
    regular and disturbing procession. At any given point in time gang members
    may simultaneously have associates in prison and on the street. The movement from one
    environment to the other is, for some, a change in address only. For the most hardened gang members, time in prison may be seen as a
    reprieve from life on the streets, a way to establish and/or solidify
    inter-gang relationships, and a way of gaining in status upon their release.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/concerned_about.htm">Why
    be Concerned about Gangs?</a></font></b></p>
    <p>The experiences I've had with gangs was an eye-opener for me. I didn't realize how harmful gangs and their members were.
    It
    seems like everything they touch is destroyed - lives, homes, families,
    neighborhoods, and the future of their own members.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I keep reminding myself
    that the <i> gang members</i> <i> aren't</i> <i>the</i>  <i>problem</i>, although they are <i>a</i>
    problem. My attention has turned, instead, towards learning about the risk
    factors which cause gangs to form - and which lead some youths to join them
    - and the protective factors which retard this process.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/parents.htm">Parents of Gang Members</a></font></b></p>
    <p>I don't know whether to feel sorry for the parents of gang members
    (the ones who are not gang members themselves) or to feel sorry for the gang
    members who have incompetent parents. It seems a vicious cycle to me. A cycle of neglect or some other form of abuse and of
    shattered or broken relationships (single parents) and substance abuse.</p>
    <p>Combined with living in a
    culture of violence, grinding poverty, and hopelessness, what alternatives
    do most of these parents have? Although some were children when they gave
    birth to their children, many are upstanding people - parents who raised
    other children who did not get involved with gangs.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I don't know what to say about parents who refuse to accept the fact
    that their child is a member of a gang. The wake up call often arrives
    too late. Were I to feel any sympathy, it is for the
    situation in which many good parents find themselves - trapped in
    gang-dominated neighborhoods, struggling to get out, frightened of staying
    in and losing their children to gangs.</p>
