		thought to belong to a gang. After the constitutionality of the law was

		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">Rookie author Douglas

		between Century, a Jewish-Canadian Princeton alum, and Big K, a black 
		New Yorker trying to overcome his criminal past and become a rap star. 
		Their five-year relationship--full of culture clashes at turns funny, 
		depressing, and harrowing--allows Century to examine prison life, the 
		sociology of gangs, and the meaning of success in the 1990s. Big K is an 
		irresistible character study: a 270-pound, larger-than-life, one-man 
		melting pot with roots in Jamaica and Panama. His raps blend Caribbean 
		slang, Spanish influences, and the sensibilities (and insensibilities) 
		of urban America. The book's heavy use of profanity may be authentic, 
		but it's also numbing, and Century's decision to use aliases diminishes 
		his otherwise fine journalism.</span></p>

		been highly effective in controlling violent and predatory behaviour,

		notorious prisoners transferred to the ADX. Despite a shift of policy 
		from therapeutic intervention towards deterrence of problem behaviour in

		Glasgow acquired a reputation throughout Britain as a hotbed of gang 
		violence. Contemporary depictions of Glasgow borrowed freely from images 
		of &quot;the gangster&quot; derived from the USA and Hollywood-produced gangster 
		movies, which were massively popular in Britain, provided templates for 
		journalists and aspiring gang members alike. The city's notoriety was 
		sealed by the publication of the novel &quot;No Mean City&quot;, the story of a 
		Gorbals gang leader and &quot;razor king&quot; in October 1935. This made a 
		massive, immediate and lasting impact, cementing the name of Glasgow as 
		a byword for violence. This book offers a thorough social history of the 
		infamous street gangs of Glasgow in the 1920s and '30s.</span></p>

		</sup>the youth gang phenomenon using five increasingly restrictive<sup>

		by researchers and practitioners for years. In 1998, the Office of 
		Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reported there were 28,700 
		gangs and 780,200 gang members in the United States (National Institute 
		of Justice, 2000). These findings represent a 7%decrease in the number 
		of gangs and an 8% decrease in the number of gang members since 1996. 
		These decreases, however, are not recognized by society, as the presence 
		of gangs is portrayed by the media with visual images and graphic 
		descriptions of drug sales, turf wars, drive by shootings and 
		drug-related murders.</span></p>

		Correctional Officer Robert Schober that replicate some of the most 
		common tattoos worn by members of each of the groups discussed. This 
		groundbreaking work makes a substantial amount of previously classified 
		information available to the general public for the first time. In 
		addition to presenting the latest intel on white, black, Hispanic and 
		Asian gangs, it also includes new information on groups such as the 
		White Afrikaner Resistance Movement and the Russian Mafia, which add to 
		the mounting challenge faced by those laboring to hold the line against 
		the menace posed by gangs, hate groups and organized crime.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
		<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">When researchers investigate the 
		relationships between media behavior and criminal behavior, they tend to 
		focus on the links between the content preferences of offenders and the 
		types of crime they have committed. Offenders, however, also differ with 
		respect to their degree of criminal involvement. Although some authors 
		indicate that the consumption of socially disvalued media contents may 
		have a symbolic value for people with a high degree of criminal 
		involvement, or suggest that media may provide them with useful 
		information, the link between this criminality dimension and media use 
		has seldom been thoroughly studied. This article describes the results 
		of a qualitative and quantitative study into the media use of prisoners 
		in five Flemish penitentiaries. It illustrates that the variable degree 
		of subjective criminal involvement is a particularly strong predictor of 
		media uses, preferences, and interests among confined offenders. </span>

		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">The Japanese term &quot;Bosozoku&quot; 
		refers to a specific Japanese phenomenon, the teengage bike gangs based 
		in the urban centres of Japan that gather every weekend in the major 
		metropolises, such as Osaka and Tokyo, for mass rallies of bikers in 
		their thousands. First formed in the 1950s, when the Hell's Angels in 
		the US reached their apogee with Marlon Brando in &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;, the 
		Bosozoku have a tame equivalent in the Mods and Rockers that fought 
		pitched battles on Brighton Beach in Britain in the 1960s. They are also 
		considered in Japan to be the first rung on the ladder for would-be 
		members of the Yakuza (the Japanese equivalent of the Mafia). This text 
		reveals the intimate secrets of Japanese biker gangs, including female 
		biker gangs, alongside studio portraits of individual members with their 
		customized bikes, and the mass rallies and road wars that have made the 
		Bosozoku subculture such a world-wide underground phenomenon.</span></p>
