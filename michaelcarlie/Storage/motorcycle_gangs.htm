    <blockquote>
		<p>With the war over in 1945, thousands of veterans drifted back home trying
    to take up their lives. However, many missed the excitement of the war. One
    of the ways to look for the type of excitement they searched for was riding
    a high-powered Harley Davidson or Indian motorcycle. Hollywood has also
    multiplied the effect of motorcycle gangs. Movies like &quot;Easy
    Rider&quot;, &quot;Hell's Angels on Wheels&quot; and &quot;The Wild
    One&quot; have a large following.<br><br>Bike gangs which started in the 50's as loosely knit rowdy groups, began to
    gain popularity and status in the 60's and are now reorganized as a
    dangerous organized criminal group. According to the American Motorcycle
    Assn. (A.M.A.) these outlaw bikers represent about 1% of the nation's
    bikers.&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">The outlaw bikers are involved in murder, rape, assault, burglary,
    narcotics, theft, prostitution, weapons offenses and intimidation of the
    public and witnesses. They pose a threat to society in general and law
    enforcement because of their possession of and expertise in sophisticated
    weapons and their intricate intelligence network.<br><br>Not all outlaw gangs are sophisticated criminal organizations. Only four
    appear to have a large national impact which would warrant an investigation
    for violation of the Title 18 United States Code 1962, the Federal
    &quot;Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations&quot; (RICO) stature.
    They are: The Hell's Angels, Outlaws, Pagans and Bandidos. They are often
    referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. All four motorcycle clubs have
    chapters in several states. The Hell's Angels have chapters in Canada,
    throughout Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The Pagan's have a chapter in
    Australia.</p>

    </font><b><font size="3" font color="#990033">The History</font></b></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" FONT>The Hollister, California, Incident: On July 4th weekend in 1946 the
    American Motorcycle Assn. (A.M.A.) was sponsoring the Annual Motorcycle Dirt
    Hill Climb Races.&nbsp; It was held in the small town of Hollister,
    California. Hollister had a police force of seven.<br><br>The town filled with bikers. Two of the larger motorcycle groups to attend
    were the &quot;Pissed Off Bastards of Bloomington&quot; (P.O.B.O.B.) and the
    &quot;Market Street Commandoes&quot;. During the evenings drag races and bar
    and street fights were common. One member of the P.O.B.O.B. was arrested and
    jailed. A large mob gathered and demanded his release. When local
    authorities refused, the estimated mob of 750 literally tore the small
    community apart.<br><br>The Hollister incident contributed three very important biker traditions
    that survive to this day: the 4th of July run, the one per center image, and
    calling anyone not part of the sub-cult, &quot;Citizen&quot;.&nbsp; After
    Hollister, the P.O.B.O.B.'s membership started increasing and the new blood
    came in with new ideas. After much consideration one idea was a name change.
    The new identity they chose was &quot;Hell's Angels.</font></p>

    chapters in several countries.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>National President</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>Many times the founder of the club.
    He will usually be located at or near the national headquarters. He will be
    surrounded by bodyguards and organizational enforcers.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><font size="3" FONT color="#990033"><b>Territorial or Regional
    Representatives</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>In some cases called the national
    vice president in charge of a specific region or state.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>National Secretary / Treasurer</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>He is responsible for the club's
    money and collecting dues from local chapters. He also records any by-law
    changes and record any minutes.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>National Enforcer</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>This person answers directly to the
    national president. He acts as a body guard and gives out punishment for
    club violations. He has also been known to locate former members and
    retrieve colors or remove the club's tattoo from them.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>Chapter President</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>This person has either claimed the
    position or has been voted in. He has final authority over all chapter
    business and members.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>Chapter Secretary / Treasurer</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>This is usually the member with the
    best writing skills and probably the most education. He will maintain the

    responsible for collecting dues, keeping minutes and paying for any bills
    the chapter accumulates.</font></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>This person is in charge of
    maintaining order at club meetings. Because of the violent nature of outlaw
    gangs this person is normally the strongest member physically and is loyal
    to the chapter president. He may administer beatings to fellow members for
    violations of club rules. He is the club enforcer.</font></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>These are the club's hopefuls who
    spend from one month to one year in a probationary status. They must prove
    during that time if they are worthy of becoming members. Some clubs have the
    probate commit a felony with fellow members observing in an effort to weed
    out the weak and stop infiltration by law enforcement. Probates must be
    nominated by a regular member and receive a unanimous vote for acceptance.
    They are known to carry weapons for other club members and stand guard at
    club functions. The probate wears no colors and has no voting rights.</font></p>

		<p><font color="black" size="3" font>All outlaw motorcycle clubs have by-laws or a constitution<br>that sets an acceptable standard of conduct and administrative<br>procedures for the club. The by-laws cover matters such as membership
    requirement, penalties for misconduct, and acceptable behavior during runs
    or meetings. While by-laws differ from club to club the following are
    examples of common by- laws.</font></p>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>All members must be male and
                at least 18 years of age. All prospective new members much be

                another without the permission of both presidents and will pay a
                transfer fee to the national treasure. When a member is in
                another jurisdiction, he will abide by their by-laws and
                president.</font></p>
		<p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>Any member caught using the needle will lose his colors and

	<p><b><font size="3" font color="#990033">Women and the Outlaw
    Biker </font></b></p><font color="black" size="3" FONT>
    <blockquote>
		<p align="left">Outlaw motorcycle gangs are male dominated and highly
    chauvinistic. Women are treated as playthings and property. Women are
    generally victimized by forcing them into prostitution or street level drug
    traffickers, and quite often physically and sexually abused. In the outlaw
    biker's society women are bought, sold, traded or given away within the
    club.<br><br>Selling drugs in the mid 1960's teaches the outlaw biker the basics of
    supply and demand. When they learn men pay to rent the empty space between a
    woman's leg, they put their women to work. In the violent, profit-oriented
    society inhabited by the outlaw biker, that's all a woman is - a hole, a
    piece of property to rent or trade.<br><br>Women take up with outlaw bikers for different reasons: some are hungry,
    some need a warm place to stay, and others feel safe in a crowd. While
    outlaw bikers abduct and rape many women, most attach themselves voluntarily
    to the club and everything it stands for - drugs, alcohol, parties, fast
    bikes and cars, cheap thrills and sex. Horny women want endless sex every
    way it comes, the club becomes their outlet. Rebellious teenagers who strike
    back at their parents numb their minds with drugs and screw their brains out
    on the clubhouse floor. Bored business women take a walk on the wild side
    with macho men who lead dangerous, exiting lives. Women without education
    become somebody when they attach themselves to respected and feared outlaw
    bikers. Shiftless girls like the freedom from responsibility. The unloved
    and homeless confuse sex with affection and cherish the arms that hold them.<br>
		<br>A woman's main value to an outlaw biker, aside from sexual<br>gratification is daily income. She must give all her money to her old man.
    Bikers put their women to work in massage parlors, topless bars, cocktail
    lounges and strip clubs. Most are covers for prostitution. Prostitution is
    the bikers' most lucrative source of income after drugs.<br><br>Another area where the women are used effectively is intelligence gathering.
    They will go into the community and take jobs at city, county and state
    offices where they have access to blank birth certificates, drivers licenses
    and other useful documentations. Other areas of employment the women will
    seek is that of police records clerk, telephone operators, employees in
    welfare offices and position within prison institutions. They will even
    sleep with cops to compromise them or gather intelligence. Women of
    motorcycle gangs mainly fall into three categories:</p>
		<p align="left">
    </font><b><font size="3" font color="#990033">Mama or Sheep</font><br></b>
		<font color="black" size="3" FONT>A mama is the sexual equivalent of a
    public well. Anyone can dip into her, at any time, as often as he wants.
    These are woman who belong to the club at large. They belong to every member
    and are expected to consent to the sexual desires of anyone at anytime. They
    perform menial task around the clubhouse, however do not attend club
    meetings. Some clubs permit these women to wear .. colors&quot; with the
    inscription &quot;Property of (club name)&quot;, embroidered on the back.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>Old Lady</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" FONT>These are the wives or steady
    girlfriends of club members. An old lady is the property of one biker and
    can't be used or abused by other club members. An old lady is not a club
    member and like sheep are not permitted to attend club meetings. They also
    will in some clubs wear &quot;Property of&quot; colors; however, with the
    name of the biker she belongs to on the bottom rocker.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>Broad<br></b>
		</font><font color="black" size="3" FONT>A female who's sole use is being
    used as a sexual object. This would be similar to the way most men view one
    night stands. A common method of bikers is to pick up a female hitchhiker,
    gang rapes her and then toss her aside.<br><br>Women are always helping the outlaw biker to get ahead. An example - several
    Hell's Angels have their old ladies turn tricks in topless bars in North and
    South Carolina. The bars are near military bases and the old ladies get all
    the weapons the club needs. The Cleveland Chapter got three light antitank
    weapons (LAW) rockets through their old ladies. Other chapters have gotten
    .45 caliber pistols and hand grenades from their women</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font size="3" font color="#990033"><b>The Big Four</b></font></p>
    <font color="black" size="3" FONT>
    <blockquote>
		<p align="left">The Big Four outlaw gangs claim to be the one percent of
    motorcyclists who won't conform to society's laws and morals ethics. They
    are the Hell's Angels, the Outlaws, the Pagans and the Bandidos. All of them
    are U.S. based and have international chapters with the exception of the
    Pagans.<br><br>The Big Four are guided by their own code of terror. They strive to maintain
    their reputation as outlaws by instilling in people a fear they interpret as
    respect. The gangs keep members in line and eliminate the opposition with
    squads of killers: the Hell's Angels Filthy Few, the Outlaws' SS, the
    Pagans' Black T- shirt squad, and the Bandidos' Nomad Chapter.<br><br>The Big Four earn most of their money making and selling drugs. They control
    75% of the North American Methamphetamine market. Prostitution, extortion,
    theft, arson, robbery, bombings and contact murders are among the crimes
    that bring in millions more. The Big Four are paramilitary operations fueled
    by greed and run on fear. Members are armed with the latest in military
    technology and protected by the best lawyers.<br><br>Two of the Big Four motorcycles are locked in a death battle since 1974. The
    Hell's Angels and Outlaws kill each other's members at every opportunity.
    They also encourage smaller clubs to expand their territory and bolster
    their strength. Gangs that resist takeovers don't last long; their drug
    supplies dry up or they are destroyed.
