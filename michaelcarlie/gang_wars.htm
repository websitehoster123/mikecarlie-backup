		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">First, suburban, small-town, and

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Second, the practices employed by

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Third, there is ample evidence

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Other policy makers may propose 
		adoption of a fourth option – a “balanced” approach that combines the 
		gang enforcement tactics described here with provision of services and 
		supports to gang members and gang-afflicted communities.&nbsp; The choice of 
		a gang enforcement strategy is frequently based on political and 
		institutional considerations.&nbsp; Officials seek strategies that let the 
		public know they are “doing something” about the problem without 
		requiring fundamental changes in the police department’s operations.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The official response to an 
		emerging gang problem is rarely based on a solid understanding of gang 
		issues or a coherent theory of what an intervention should accomplish.&nbsp; 
		The hysteria that greets the sudden emergence of a gang problem creates 
		a poor atmosphere for considering the questions that will determine the 
		success or failure of a gang control strategy:&nbsp; What are its <i>
		objectives</i>?&nbsp; Whom will it <i>target</i>?&nbsp; And what <i>effect</i> 
		will the initiatives have on the targets in order to achieve the 
		objectives?</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The objectives of a gang control 
		effort depend on whether the problem is defined as gang violence, gang 
		crime, or the gangs’ very existence.&nbsp; Law enforcement officials often 
		take the public position that gangs must be eradicated.&nbsp; In the words of 
		Captain Ray Peavy, who heads the Los Angeles sheriff’s homicide bureau, 
		“Everyone says:&nbsp; ‘What are we going to do about the gang problem?’&nbsp; It’s 
		the same thing you do about cockroaches or insects;&nbsp; you get someone in 
		there to do whatever they can do to get rid of those creatures”&nbsp; (Garvey 
		and McGreevy 2007).</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Others take a different 
		perspective on what gang control efforts can, or should, set out to 
		accomplish.&nbsp; As a representative of one urban community development 
		corporation told a researcher, “The problem is not to get kids out of 
		gangs but the behavior.&nbsp; If crime goes down, if young people are doing 
		well, that’s successful” (Villaruel, personal communication).&nbsp; Some law 
		enforcement officers also acknowledge – usually in private – that their 
		goal in not to eliminate gang <i>membership</i> but to reduce levels of 
		gang <i>crime</i> and <i>violence</i> (Villaruel, personal 
		communication).</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The second important question for 
		gang control efforts is whom to target.&nbsp; On one hand, an initiative may 
		elect to target “leaders” or “hard-core” members who are believed to be 
		the driving force behind gang crime.&nbsp; On the other hand, the initiative 
		may target “fringe” members or even nonmembers whom policy makers 
		believe can more easily be enticed or deterred from gang activity.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The most appropriate target 
		depends on one’s theory about how gangs operate.&nbsp; Some law enforcement 
		officials subscribe to the view that gangs can be eliminated or at least 
		neutralized by removing their leadership (“cutting the head of the 
		snake”).&nbsp; Others argue that gang leadership is fluid, and that gangs – 
		like the mythical hydra – are capable of growing new heads faster than 
		law enforcement can decapitate them.&nbsp; Some contend that so-called 
		“hard-core” members should be targeted because they do (and suffer) the 
		most damage.&nbsp; But others believe that a focus on newer and more marginal 
		members will not only save more youth but also limit gangs’ ability to 
		reproduce themselves over time.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">If drive-by shootings and other 
		spectacular acts of gang violence are committed by younger members…</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">(pg. 68) . . . at the behest of 
		leaders, then it is possible – although not certain – that removing the 
		leaders from the community might reduce violence.&nbsp; If, on the other 
		hand, drive-bys and other acts of violence are initiated by younger and 
		more volatile members with poor impulse control and a desire to “prove” 
		themselves, then removing leaders will do nothing to quell the violence.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The third critical question for 
		gang control efforts is what effects they are intended to have on the 
		targets.&nbsp; A gang control initiative may set out to <i>incapacitate</i> 
		gang members who are deemed too dangerous to remain on the street due to 
		their role in the gang or their personal involvement in crime and 
		violence.&nbsp; An initiative may also seek to use “carrots” or “sticks” to
		<i>persuade</i> individuals to change behaviors ranging from gang 
		membership to gun violence.&nbsp; Finally, a gang control initiative may try 
		to <i>disrupt</i> gang activities by making it impossible for 
		individuals or the group as a whole to function normally.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Further, the thrust of most gang 
		enforcement efforts runs counter to what is known about gangs and gang 
		members, rendering the efforts ineffectual if not counterproductive.&nbsp; 
		Police officials make much of targeting reputed “leaders” while ignoring 
		the fact that most gangs do not need leaders to function (not to mention 
		the risk that removal of leaders will increase violence by destabilizing 
		the gang and removing constraints on internal conflict).&nbsp; Research on 
		the dynamics of gang membership indicates that suppression tactics 
		intended to make youth “think twice” about gang involvement may instead 
		reinforce gang cohesion, elevation the gang’s importance and reinforcing 
		an “us versus them” mentality.&nbsp; Finally, the incarceration of gang 
		members is often considered a measure of success, even though prison 
		tends to solidify gang involvement and weaken an individual’s capacity 
		to live a gang- and crime-free life.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Findings from investigations of 
		gang enforcement efforts in 17 jurisdictions over the past two decades 
		yield few examples of success, and many examples of failure.</font></b></p>

		gang suppression</b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The purpose of suppression is to 
		reduce gang-related activity by current gang members, and to reduce the 
		number of people who choose to participate in gangs, by providing for 
		swifter, severer, and more certain punishment.&nbsp; The guiding assumption 
		is that, in the words of Malcolm Klein, “the targets of suppression, the 
		gang members and potential gang members, will respond ‘rationally’ to 
		suppression efforts [and] will weigh the consequences&nbsp; of gang activity, 
		redress the balance between cost and benefit, and withdraw from gang 
		activity” (Katz and Webb 2003a).</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The reality of gang suppression 
		is more complicated.&nbsp; Father Greg Boyle, founder of Homeboy Industries, 
		argues that gang membership is not a rational choice but rather a 
		desperate response to profound misery (2005).</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The research literature on gangs 
		also indicates that suppression efforts can be counterproductive.&nbsp; Such 
		tactics can increase gang cohesion by reinforcing an “us versus them” 
		mentality, and by providing external validation of the gang’s 
		importance:</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Suppression efforts face other 
		challenges as well.&nbsp; Suppression campaigns tend to cast a wide net that 
		catches gang members and nonmembers alike.&nbsp; Stepped-up enforcement of 
		public ordinances and the use of aggressive stop-and-search tactics can 
		increase tensions between law enforcement and community members who feel 
		that police are targeting the wrong people or engaging in racial 
		profiling.&nbsp; Community members may feel less inclined to cooperate with 
		police, making the task of law enforcement even more difficult.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">(pg. 72) When suppression efforts 
		are subject to more rigorous evaluation . . . researchers often find 
		that celebrated drops in crime are attributable to larger trends, 
		seasonal fluctuations, or chance.</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Civil gang injunctions are legal 
		tools that are designed to enhance targeted suppression efforts.&nbsp; The 
		injunctions treat gangs as unincorporated associations whose members can 
		be held responsible by civil courts for creating a public nuisance and 
		enjoined from otherwise lawful behaviors.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">. . . injunctions apply only to 
		named (alleged) gang members rather than to all youth who hang out on 
		the street, skip school, or violate city ordinances.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The restrictions to civil 
		liberties that accompany a gang injunction are justified by a perceived 
		need to save communities from a gang-imposed “state of siege.”</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Law enforcement and the media 
		report impressive reductions in crime and fear through the use of gang 
		injunctions.&nbsp; Maxson and her colleagues observe that these stories “are 
		often compelling, but are never buttressed with supporting evidence that 
		meets minimal scientific standards of evaluation.”&nbsp; [(Maxson, Hennigan, 
		and Sloane 2003)]</font></b></p>

		“hard-core” gang members</b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The “targeting” of selected gang 
		members by the criminal justice system is a second popular response to 
		gang problems.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">The tactics employed to target 
		gang members can include sentencing enhancements, special prosecution 
		units, and stepped-up surveillance by law enforcement and corrections 
		officials.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Targeting, like suppression, 
		faces a number of challenges.&nbsp; The first and foremost is the difficulty 
		of identifying the right targets.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">(pg. 79) The second challenge is 
		to intervene with targeted gang members in ways that do not exacerbate 
		the problem over the long run.&nbsp; The most likely outcome of targeting is 
		the incarceration of gang members in youth detention facilities, jails, 
		or prisons.&nbsp; And there is evidence that these institutions not only 
		weaken the capacity of incarcerated individuals to lead law-abiding 
		lives upon release but also strengthen gang ties.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">(pg. 81) A recent literature 
		survey on the impact of incarcerating youth in detention and other 
		secure facilities found that first incarceration experiences make youth 
		more likely to commit new crimes.&nbsp; Research on youth committed to state 
		facilities in Arkansas found that prior to incarceration was a stronger 
		predictor of future recidivism than gang membership, carrying a weapon, 
		or a poor parental relationship (Benda and Tollett 1999).</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">(pg. 82) Terance Miethe and 
		Richard McCorkle found that gang members prosecuted by specialized gang 
		units were no more likely to be convicted or imprisoned than defendants 
		whose cases were handled by prosecutors in traditional “track” units 
		(2002).</font></b></p>

		approaches to gang enforcement</b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Public officials who recognize 
		the failure of traditional suppression and targeting efforts to reduce 
		gang violence have sought to develop more “balanced” models of gang 
		enforcement.&nbsp; The two best-known models for balanced gang enforcement 
		are Operation Ceasefire, and initiative launched in Boston to reduce 
		youth gun violence, and the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Juvenile 
		Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) Comprehensive Gang Model, 
		which was developed by researcher Irving Spergel in Chicago.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Both models require law
