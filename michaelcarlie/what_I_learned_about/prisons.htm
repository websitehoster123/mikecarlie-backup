    <p>As the gang phenomenon has grown and spread in America's cities and
    counties, there has been a parallel growth and spread
    of gangs in America's prisons. There's no way to
    know how many prisons have gang member inmates due, in part, to the fact
    that &quot;Politics generally determine whether agencies [prisons] ... admit
    to having STGs [Security Threat Groups like gangs].&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Baugh1993">Baugh</a>,
    1993)&nbsp; </font>It may also be impossible to gather accurate information 
	on how many of America's prisoners are involved in gang activity. However, judging from my own observations and other current research on the
    subject, one may safely say gangs and their members are prevalent in many prisons in
    the United States and elsewhere.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In some prisons, inmate gang members were members of gangs prior to their
    incarceration. They were arrested, incarcerated and,
    while incarcerated, continue to recruit and build their gang. Other gang members 
	in prison had no gang affiliation prior to their imprisonment but joined
    one of the prison gangs - many of which have counterparts on the streets. In other prisons, notably in California and Texas, gangs have formed which had no counterpart on the street.
    The gangs were created in prison. Examples of these gangs include the
    Mexican Mafia, Neta, Aryan Brotherhood, Black Guerrilla Family, La Nuestra
    Familia and the Texas Syndicate.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The nature of the prison gang problem was highlighted by Fleisher and 
	Decker <b><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FleisherDecker2001">2001</a>)
	</font></b>in their article entitled &quot;An Overview of the Challenge of Prison 
	Gangs.&quot; They found that:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><b><font size="2">A persistently disruptive force in correctional 
		facilities is prison gangs.&nbsp; Prison gangs disrupt correctional 
		programming, threaten the safety of inmates and staff, and erode 
		institutional quality of life.&nbsp; The authors review the history of, and 
		correctional mechanisms to cope with prison gangs.&nbsp; A suppression 
		strategy (segregation, lockdowns, transfers) has been the most common 
		response to prison gangs.&nbsp; The authors argue, however, that given the 
		complexity of prison gangs, effective prison gang intervention must 
		include improved strategies for community re-entry and more 
		collaboration between correctional agencies and university gang 
		researchers on prison gang management policies and practices. (p. 1)</font></b></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Prison gangs are not a new phenomenon. As Fleisher and Decker <b><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FleisherDecker2001">2001</a>)&nbsp;
	</font></b>found: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><b><font size="2">The first known American prison gang was the Gypsy 
		Jokers formed in the 1950s in Washington state prisons.&nbsp; The first 
		prison gang with nationwide ties was the Mexican Mafia, which emerged in 
		1957 in the California Department of Corrections.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font size="2">Camp and Camp identified approximately 114 gangs 
		with a membership of approximately 13,000 inmates.&nbsp; Of the 49 agencies 
		surveyed, 33 indicated that they had gangs in their system:&nbsp; 
		Pennsylvania reported 15 gangs, Illinois reported 14.&nbsp; Illinois had 
		5,300 gang members, Pennsylvania had 2,400, and California had 2,050.&nbsp; 
		In Texas, there were nine prison gangs with more that 50 members each, 
		totaling 2,407.&nbsp; Fong reported eight Texas gangs with 1,174 members.&nbsp; 
		Illinois reported that 34.3 percent of inmates belonged to a prison 
		gang, which was then the highest percent of prison gang-affiliated 
		inmates in the nation </font></b></p>
		<p><b><font size="2">Lane reported that the Illinois Department of 
		Corrections (IDOC) estimated the inmate gang population to be nearly 90 
		percent of the entire population, attributing that number to the 
		importation of gangs from Chicagos streets, which is supported by 
		research.&nbsp;Reesshows that Chicago police estimated more than 19,000 gang 
		members in that city and a high percent of IDOC inmates were arrested in 
		Cook County.&nbsp; Other correctional agencies, however, report their gang 
		troubles started inside rather than outside prison walls.&nbsp; Camp and Camp 
		cite that of the 33 agencies surveyed, 26 reported street counterparts 
		to prison gangs.</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Knox and Tromanhauser suggest there are 
		approximately 100,000 or more prison gang members across the 
		nation.&nbsp;Subsequent to Camp and Camp the American Correctional 
		Association found that prison gang membership doubled between 1985 and 
		1992 from 12,624 to 46,190, with relatively few gang members in minimum 
		security units.&nbsp; Later, Montgomery and Crews argued that Knox and 
		Tromanhauser overestimated the prison gang population and cited the 
		American Correctional Associations 1993 study that reported some 50,000 
		prison gang members.</b></font></p>

		<p><b><font size="2"><font color="#800080">The Mexican 
		Mafia</font> (La Eme) started at the Deuel Vocational Center in Tracy, 
		California, in the 1950s and was Californias first prison gang composed 
		primarily of Chicanos, or Mexican Americans.&nbsp;Entrance into La Eme 
		requires a sponsoring member. Each recruit has to undergo a blood oath 
		to prove his loyalty.&nbsp;The Mexican Mafia does not proscribe killing its 
		members who do not follow instructions.&nbsp;Criminal activities include drug 
		trafficking and conflict with other prison gangs, which is common with 
		the Texas Syndicate, Mexikanemi, and the Aryan Brotherhood (AB).</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font size="2"><font color="#800080">The Aryan Brotherhood</font>, 
		a white supremacist group, was started in 1967 in Californias San 
		Quentin prison by white inmates who wanted to oppose the racial threat 
		of black and Hispanic inmates and/or counter the organization and 
		activities of black and Hispanic gangs.&nbsp;Pelz, Marquart, and Pelz suggest 
		that the AB held distorted perceptions of blacks and that many Aryans 
		felt that black inmates were taking advantage of white inmates, 
		especially sexually, thus promoting the need to form and/or join the 
		Brotherhood.&nbsp;Joining the AB requires a 6-month probationary period.&nbsp; 
		Initiation, or making ones bones, requires killing someone.&nbsp;The AB 
		trafficks in drugs and has a blood in, blood out rule; natural death is 
		the only nonviolent way out.&nbsp;The Aryan Brotherhood committed eight 
		homicides in 1984, or 32 percent of inmate homicides in the Texas 
		correctional system, and later became known as the mad dog of Texas 
		corrections.</font></b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b><font size="2">The Aryan Brotherhood structure within the federal 
		prison system used a three-member council of high-ranking members.&nbsp;Until 
		recently, the federal branch of the Aryan Brotherhood was aligned with 
		the California Aryan Brotherhood, but differences in opinion caused them 
		to split into separate branches.&nbsp;The federal branch no longer cooperates 
		with the Mexican Mafia in such areas as drugs and contract killing 
		within prisons, but as of October 1997, the California branch still 
		continued to associate with the Mexican Mafia.&nbsp;Rees suggested that the 
		Aryan Brotherhood aligned with other supremacist organizations to 
		strengthen its hold in prisons.&nbsp; The Aryan Brotherhood also has strong 
		chapters on the streets, which allows criminal conduct inside and 
		outside prisons to support each other.</font></b></p>

		<p><b><font size="2">Black Panther George Jackson united black groups 
		such as the Black Liberation Army, Symbionese Liberation Army, and the 
		Weatherman Underground Organization to form one large organization, the 
		<font color="#800080">Black Guerilla Family</font>, which emerged in San Quentin in 1966. Leaning on 
		a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, the Black Guerilla Family was considered 
		to be one of the more politically charged revolutionary gangs, which 
		scared prison management and the public.&nbsp;Recently, offshoots within the 
		Black Guerilla Family have appeared.&nbsp; California reported the appearance 
		of a related group known as the Black Mafia.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font size="2"><font color="#800080">La Nuestra Familia </font>(our family) was established 
		in the 1960s in Californias Soledad prison, although some argue it 
		began in the Deuel Vocational Center.&nbsp;The original members were Hispanic 
		inmates from Northern Californias agricultural Central Valley who 
		aligned to protect themselves from the Los Angeles-based Mexican 
		Mafia.&nbsp;La Nuestra Familia has a formal structure and rules as well as a 
		governing body known as La Mesa, or a board of directors.&nbsp;Today, La 
		Nuestra Familia still wars against the Mexican Mafia over drug 
		trafficking but the war seems to be easing in California.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font size="2"><font color="#800080">The Texas Syndicate </font>emerged in 1958 at Deuel 
		Vocational Institute in California.&nbsp;It appeared at Californias Folsom 
		Prison in the early 1970s and at San Quentin in 1976 because other gangs 
		were harassing native Texans.&nbsp;Inmate members are generally Texas Mexican 
		Americans, but now the Texas Syndicate offers membership to Latin 
		Americans and perhaps Guamese as well.&nbsp; The Texas Syndicate opposes 
		other Mexican American gangs, especially those from Los 
		Angeles.&nbsp;Dominating the crime agenda is drug trafficking inside and 
		outside prison and selling protection to inmates.</font></b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b><font size="2">Like other prison gangs, the Texas Syndicate has a 
		hierarchical structure with a president and vice president and an 
		appointed chairman in each local area, either in a prison or in the 
		community.&nbsp;The chairman watches over that areas vice chairman, captain, 
		lieutenant, sergeant at arms, and soldiers.&nbsp;Lower-ranking members 
		perform the gangs criminal activity.&nbsp;The gangs officials, except for 
		the president and vice president, become soldiers again if they are 
		moved to a different prison, thus avoiding local-level group conflict.&nbsp; 
		Proposals within the gang are voted on, with each member having one 
		vote; the majority decision determines group behavior.</font></b></p>

		also as the <font color="#800080">Texas Mexican Mafia</font>) was 
		established in 1984. Its name and symbols cause confusion with the 
		Mexican Mafia.&nbsp; As the largest gang in the Texas prison system, it is 
		emerging in the federal system as well and has been known to kill 
		outside as will as inside prison.&nbsp;The Mexikanemi spars with the Mexican 
		Mafia and the Texas Syndicate, although it has been said that the 
		Mexikanemi and the Texas Syndicate are aligning themselves against the 
		Mexican Mafia (Orlando-Morningstar, 1997).&nbsp;The Mexikanemi has a 
		president, vice president, regional generals, lieutenants, sergeants, 
		and soldiers.&nbsp;The ranking positions are elected by the group based on 
		leadership skills.&nbsp; Members keep their positions unless they are 
		reassigned to a new prison.&nbsp;The Mexikanemi has a 12-part

		<p><b><font size="2">Hunt et al. suggest that the Nortenos and the

	<p>If Beck's 1991 estimate that approximately 12% of prison inmates were
    gang-affiliated could be extrapolated to today, then perhaps as many as 148,496 gang members
    (12% of all 1,237,469 inmates) were confined in state and federal prisons on
    December 31, 2000.&nbsp;If, in order to be a gang, at least five

    gang members (6% of all 1,237,469 inmates). According to <a href="#100,000">Yager</a>,

      <p>With the possibility of so many prison inmates involved in gang
      activity, what impact do they have?&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"> <b><font color="#800000">The <a name="Impact"> Impact</a> of Prison Gangs</font></b></p>
    <p>Inmate gangs have an impact on prisoners' lives and well-being in prison, on prison
    administrators and staff and on the residents of neighborhoods into which they move upon 
    their release from prison.
    The impact of prison gangs on prisoners' lives may be measured by the amount
    of violence which takes place in the prison. While it may be said that gangs
    play a role in stabilizing the inmate environment (by protecting some
    inmates from assaults, exploitation, or other harm), Gabriel (1996) believes they also contribute to
    the amount of violence found in prison.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>While in prison, inmates are subject
    to prison politics, racism, corruption, barbarism, and the misconduct of
    correctional officers. The life of a gang member is in many ways tougher and
    more dangerous than if the gang member was on the outside. The biggest
    reason for this is because there is no refuge or place to lay low until
    favorable conditions arise.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b> In prison, one must always watch his back,
    gangster or not. Many gang members search out friends already in prison to
    ally themselves with so that it is not just the individual that a potential
    aggressor will pit himself against. Rather it is a group of individuals that
    carry much more clout and power to harm than one person could ever possess.
    Thus the gangs that are supposedly broken down on the outside re-form within
    the walls of prison.</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Gabriel1996">Gabriel</a>,

    <p>A one-year study of over 82,000 federal inmates in the United States 
    revealed that those who were embedded in gangs (referred to as <i>gang 
    embeddedness</i>) were more likely to exhibit violent behavior and 
    misconduct than those who were peripherally involved in gangs. And those who 
    were peripherally involved exhibited more violent behavior and misconduct 
    than those who were unaffiliated. <font size="1">(<a href="http://faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#GaesEtAl2002">Gaes</a>,

    <p>In gang-dominated prisons, gangs rule the roost. Which inmates eat at
    what times and where they sit in the dining hall, who gets the best or worst
    job assignments in the prison, who has money and nice clothes, who lives and
    who dies - all of these things, and others, are determined by gangs in the
    prison. Their very presence requires special attention from prison

      <p align="left">Prison staff, too, may be participants in or potential
      victims of the prison gang culture. As participants, they may be actively
      or passively involved. As active participants they may collude with inmate

      commission of certain crimes, or taking bribes or payment for their

    <p>As you may know, there are both state prisons and federal prisons. 
	Generally speaking, state prisons confine people who have
    been convicted of violating state law while federal prisons confine people who have 
    been convicted of violating
    federal laws. As we will see in another section of <i>Into the Abyss</i>, several
    states and the federal government have enacted laws which 
    <a href="http://faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/what_I_learned_about/legislature.htm#Enhancements">enhance or
    lengthen the sentences of convicted gang members</a>.&nbsp;Not only are there
    gang members in prison, but due to their proven gang affiliation they are
    sometimes sentenced to longer prison terms. Given what's happening in most of America's
    prisons, the longer exposure may only make the problem worse.</p>

    Among the activities of inmate gang members are drug running and cell taxing -
    charging to occupy a given cell. Some cells are designated by inmates as
    being for Caucasian inmates while others are designated for
    African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and
    so on. Cell residents may be taxed because the cells are far from the security stations
    at the end of the cellblock. I was told that &quot;The dope
    heads (drug users) like to be away from the security folks.&quot;</p>
    <p>There are usually televisions in prison cellblocks and a Hispanic inmate may be taxed for his cell
    because it is close to the television that is set on a Spanish-speaking station
    or an English- speaking inmate because it is located near an
    English-speaking station - whatever the inmate prefers and is willing to pay
    for. Some cells are closer to the TV than others and
    that may cause a cell tax to be imposed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Some prisons have rooms set aside for the sole purpose of television
    viewing. In one prison I visited, the administrator said &quot;We have several
    TV rooms and all but one of them is owned by the blacks. Only certain blacks, depending on their gang affiliation, can use certain rooms unless
    there's some popular athletic event being shown - then all of them cram in to

    Many inmates find it difficult to survive in prison unless they are
    affiliated with a gang. But there's a twist. The twist may be best explained using an analogy. Do you remember a game
    called Rock, Scissors, Paper? It's a game kids play using hand
    signs. Each player chooses rock, scissors, or paper without telling
    the other players their choice. Then each child displays their chosen
    hand sign at the same time. Rock is symbolized by a clenched fist and rock beats scissors.
    Scissors are characterized by a protruding index and&nbsp; middle finger in
    the shape of scissors blades and scissors beat paper. Paper is shown by
    holding out an open hand with fingers all touching side by side. If we stop the game there
    I can use this as an analogy that helps
    describe the gang situation in prison.</p>
    <p>In the analogy &quot;rock&quot; is race or ethnicity,
    &quot;scissors&quot; is a gang, and &quot;paper&quot; is an inmate who is
    not gang affiliated. Inmates who are not affiliated with a gang are
    often in peril in a prison setting. They have no one who will come
    to their aid if they are assaulted or extorted and no one who will join them in
    retaliation.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> There are a few exceptions to this rule. The exceptions include inmates who
    have organized crime connections on the outside, and those who are knowledgeable
    about the law and may, therefore, be valued for their ability to help other
    inmates write legal briefs for their appeals. There are other inmates who are 
    basically left
    alone because they are seriously ill or very old,
    and inmates who are so physically powerful or out of their minds that few
    inmates will assault them.</p>
    <p>Most inmates, however, are vulnerable. In our analogy the next class of
    inmates are the gang members - scissors. They assault non-gang members -
    those who are &quot;paper&quot; in our analogy, and rival gang members. According to one federal prison administrator, &quot;About one-third of
    my prison's one thousand seven hundred inmates are not in a gang. They are
    referred to by the staff as 'lame' or as<i>&nbsp;</i>'dorks<i>.</i>'&nbsp;
    They
    eat meals together in the mess hall with the First Nations People [a class
    of people that used to be called Native American Indians]. The unaffiliated are often extorted by gang inmates and used in
    other ways.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Then there are the rocks - the racial and ethnic groups. They beat
    all. That is, African-American inmates who are Crips, Bloods, Black Gangster
    Disciples, or whatever their name, are faced with a new enemy - groups of non-African-Americans. In most instances this means
    they need protection from Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic inmates in the
    prison. Suddenly prior gang affiliation and old hatreds between
    same-race/same-ethnicity gangs succumb
    to fears of racial or ethnic conflict.</p>

            and other ethnic gangs.

    <p>A correctional administrator told me &quot;There is a heavy emphasis on gathering gang intelligence inside and
    outside the prison in an effort to maintain safety and security. We
    have five Intelligence Officers within the correctional officer cadre, one

    <p>The current policy of some prison administrators in their dealings with
    incarcerated gang members is to use both intervention and suppression
    strategies. Intervention initiatives  are sometimes referred
    to as &quot;deganging&quot; or &quot;renunciation programs&quot; while some institutions segregate or
    separate gangs from one another in hopes of maintaining peace in the
    facility. The Taylorville Correctional Center in Illinois is an example of a 
    prison which does not tolerate gang activity. According to the Illinois 
    Department of Corrections:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>The department 
    designates Taylorville Correctional Center as a security threat group free 
    prison. Admission to the facility requires inmates to have no documented 
    history of security threat group membership or activity. Strong disciplinary 
    sanctions are employed for any inmate identified as participating in any 
    security threat group activity including transfer, loss of good time, 
    disciplinary segregation and loss of privileges. </b></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>All respondents reported no previous participation in
      street gangs; their active participation in prison gangs before defection
      was 3.36 years. Prison gangs are organized along paramilitary lines, and
      the majority of respondents never held any rank beyond that of
      &quot;soldier.&quot;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Additional analyses revealed that only 12 of the
      respondents admitted to having committed gang-related violence. Findings
      show that the single most important reason for leaving the gang was loss
      of interest in the gang (n=10), followed by refusing to carry out a
      &quot;hit&quot; on a non-gang member (n=9).</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Other reasons included disagreeing with the direction
      in which the gang was going (n=7), refusal to carry out a &quot;hit&quot;
      on a fellow gang member (n=6), violating a gang rule (n=5), &quot;growing
      out&quot; of it (n=5), informing prison officials about gang business
      (n=4), and refusing to engage in gang crime (n=2).&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Given that the commitment to the prison gang is

    to control them, suggest more gang members will fill our prisons' cells in the

    <p>As a result of their incarceration, gang members from different cities

    in their incarceration in <i> federal</i> prisons due to their involvement with illegal drugs. There they meet offenders from around the

    distributors, and terrorists. What are the implications of these new associations when
    inmates return to the community upon
    release from prison?</p>

    <p>As all of these gang-member inmates are released into their home 
    communities, what will their impact be on local gang members? If the 
    receiving communities don't act to provide returning inmates with housing, 
    job training, and jobs, I predict their newly achieved status as ex-convict 
    will result in their being respected in the gang community. They will 
    encourage cooperation with former enemy gangs in pursuit of greater gain and 
    increased criminality.</p>
    <p>As we've seen, gangs in prison, much like those on the street, are 
	difficult to eliminate because they have come to serve a purpose - they are 
	functional. They provide their members with protection, security, power, 
	status, income, and association with others of their own kind. This does not 
	bode well when it comes to integrating ex-convict gang members back into the 
	community once they are released or paroled from confinement.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Impediments to community integration of prison gang
      members include the facts that gangs facilitate crime; gangs are social
      groups with longevity; self-identification to a gang may persist for years
      or decades, especially among adult offenders with extensive criminal
      histories; a gang identity and accompanying social ties create a sense of
      belonging; gang members are poor and are therefore outsiders in the
      mainstream community; and gang identity is linked to self identity. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FleisherDecker2001b">Fleisher

    <p>Other than their impact on prison life and on the communities into which
    they are released, what other reasons are there for being concerned about
    gangs?&nbsp; That's our next topic.</p>
