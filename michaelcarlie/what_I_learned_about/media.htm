    <p>What you and I perceive of as &quot;reality&quot; is, in many ways, a

    media create images in our minds as to what is real. As to the role of
    other people, Surette tells us that &quot;People

    knowledge and from knowledge gained from social interactions with other people.&quot;

    <p>Americans watch a great deal of television and often base their perception of the world upon

    <p>What is the media telling us about crime? Do media portrayals
    accurately reflect the reality of crime or are they a misrepresentation of
    it? The answer to that question probably lies somewhere between
    the two. As long ago as 1976, Gerbner noted that</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>... the
      significance of the media comes from the &quot;creation of shared ways of
      selecting and viewing events,&quot; thus common ways of seeing and understanding
      the world. He calls it the &quot;cultivation of dominant image
      patterns.&quot;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b> In effect, the media tend to offer uniform and relatively
      consensual versions of social reality and their audiences are
      &quot;acculturated' accordingly. Gerbner makes a prediction that
      media, especially television because of the systematic character of its
      message and its consistency over time, have powerful effects and he comes
      down firmly in favor of the media as molders of
      society. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#McQuail1983">McQuail</a>,

      <p><font size="2"><b>About the long-term effect of media presentations,
      Gerbner believed that television cultivates a perception of reality among
      its viewers. He found that &quot;television ... has acquired such a central
      place in daily life that it dominates our symbolic environment,
      substituting its message about reality for personal experience and other
      means of knowing about the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><b> <font size="2"> The message of television is ...
      distinctive and <i>deviant</i> from 'reality' on several key points, <i> yet
      persistent exposure to it leads to its adoption as a consensual view of

      comes from systematic content analysis of American television, carried out
      over several years and showing <i> consistent distortions of reality in

    <p>The place is Sydney, Australia, and the story is of one of media
    fabrication. It provides an insight into how the media may shape our
    perception of reality and, ultimately, our response to it.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">&quot;Residents

    regarding some incidents on the East Fairfield Housing Estate. In
    fact, &quot;deuce&quot; was just a word written on walls by an 11-7ear-old boy who liked
    the word. According to youth worker Stephen Clarke, when one of the
    gang-hunting media shows turned up and asked a group of bemused young people
    how many of them were in the &quot;Deuce gang,&quot; they all thought that sounded
    like a great gang and put their hands up. The media had invented a
    'gang.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>That wasn't all. As story after story reported on

    kid thought it was the name of a gang in America. Another thought it was a

    <p>Media sensationalism, although it sells more advertising and increases the
    income of the media businesses, is a disservice to the community. In

    determined to project the opposite.</i> The lack of realistic information further

    <p>In the end, the point I will try to make is that the social policies
    we have adopted for dealing with gangs (arrest and incarcerate) are the
    result of a public perception of gangs which is incorrect - or, at the
    least, muddled, confused, and misleading. Some of the responsibility for
    this belongs to the media.</p>

    <p>Take, for example, the media's obsession with rape and murder. Long ago
    the Federal Bureau of Investigation created a category of crimes known
    as Index Crimes. The Index Crimes consist of four crimes against persons (<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99c2_03.pdf">murder</a>,
    <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99c2_04.pdf">rape</a>, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99c2_05.pdf">robbery</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99c2_06.pdf">aggravated

    (<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99c2_08.pdf">burglary</a>, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99c2_09.pdf">larceny/theft</a>,

    to be sure, but those eight are the Index Crimes (used, like the Dow Jones
    is used for the stock market - as an indicator of whether crime in the United States
    is going up or down in any given year).</p>

    Crime Reports</a>, 2001,
    <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_01/01crime4.pdf">page</a>)</font> They would be an even smaller
    proportion of <i>all</i>   crimes since not all crimes are included in the 
    Index. To accurately reflect the reality of rape and murder, then, fewer than 
    7 out of every 1000 crime-related news stories, movies, or television shows 
    should deal with rape and murder. Instead, we are bombarded by one media 
    presentation after another dealing with rape or murder to the near exclusion 
    of the other 99.3% of all Index crimes.</p>
    <p>As a result of this distortion of reality, the image created in the mind of the public is that we live in a
    very scary place where violent crimes are happening all the time and
    everywhere. According to Surette, &quot;People today live in two
    worlds: a real world and a media world.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Surette1998">Surette</a>,
    1998, p. 197)&nbsp; </font>The media world is the world created in the mind of
    viewers as defined by media portrayals. &quot;Such a portrait of the world has been associated with the development
    of a 'mean worldview' - the feeling that the world is a violent, dangerous
    place - and attitudes of fear, isolation, and suspicion.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Surette1998">Surette</a>,
    1998, p. 49)&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p>There are gang members who watch the news and listen to the radio. They go to the movies, read newspapers, magazines, and journals, and they
    surf the Internet. Media mention of their activities furthers their
    purposes. A frightened public is an easy target. Rather than
    having to intimidate the public themselves, gang members can thank the media
    for taking care of that for them.</p>
    <p>For the sake of argument, I will
    suggest the impact of media portrayals of crime and criminality on the American public's perception of
    them are similar to the impact of media portrayals of gangs -distorted,
    sensationalized, and self-serving.&nbsp;</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>The problem is that these social problems <i>are</i> linked. By
    failing to show them together, the viewing public has difficulty making the necessary connections between them.
    Media
    portrayals of crime and gangs as <i> being</i> the problem rather than being
    <i>symptoms</i> of the problems which cause them to form, are terribly misleading.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As explained in <a href="GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm#top">earlier
    portions</a> of <i>Into the Abyss</i>, gangs form in response to the
    collapse of social institutions in the neighborhoods and communities in
    which they are found. The two - gangs and our social institutions - are
    inextricably intertwined. The media seldom portray that relationship
    accurately. Media generated responses of arresting and incarcerating gang members will not reduce gang
    activity as effectively and permanently as would reducing the poverty, urban
    decay, poor schooling, substance abuse, and child abuse which contribute so
    significantly to the formation of gangs.</p>
    <p>I don't mean to suggest that criminals, and gang members among them,
    should not be held responsible for the illegal acts they commit. They
    should be held responsible and should face certain and appropriate
    punishment and/or treatment. But to only punish or treat <i> them</i> is to continue <a href="../Orientation/perspective.htm#Spigot">cleaning up
    the spill without paying any attention to turning off the spigot.</a></p>
    <p>In light of these comments, limited to a&nbsp;&quot;simplistic, incomplete picture of crime as mostly
    individual, socially isolated acts, members of each group involved
    (criminals, crime fighters, and the public) have for generations been
    receiving a misleading constructed reality in how to engage in and respond
    to crime.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Surette1998">Surette</a>, 1998, p.

    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2"> All three groups derive role models from the media. Criminals can learn how to actually commit crimes, whom to victimize, and
    when to use violence and weapons and disdain sympathy. Crime fighters
    and the public are shown that <i> counter-violence is the most effective means
    of combating crime</i>, that due process considerations hamper the police, and
    that in most cases the law works in the criminal's favor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2"><i> These images

    <p>By &quot;crime control&quot; policies Surette is referring to the
    tendency to think the crime or gang &quot;problem&quot; can be solved by arresting and
    incarcerating the offenders. Two hundred years of this policy should,
    by now, have convinced us that it doesn't work well over the long haul.
    While we have been emphasizing arrest and incarceration instead of treatment, our prison
    population, like the number of police, has been increasing and
    yet the crime rate refuses to drop significantly.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The Media-<a name="Generated">Generated</a> Response to Crime</font></b></p>
    <p> Surette believes &quot;Media solutions emphasize individual violence and aggression, with
    a preference shown for weapons and sophisticated technology.&quot;<font size="1">
    (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Surette1998">Surette</a>,
    1998, p. 47)&nbsp; </font>We talk about the &quot;war on crime&quot;
    and the &quot;war on drugs&quot; when, in fact, they are a war on criminals
    and a war on drug users and suppliers. Gang units go by such names as
    the &quot;Gang <i> Strike</i> Unit,&quot; and &quot;Gang Task <i>Force</i>,&quot;
    and we talk about &quot;attacking&quot; or
    &quot;combating&quot; gangs. The lexicon of our approach is often
    violent.</p>
    <p>In no small measure, &quot;The increasing emphasis on graphic violence has also resulted in a
    kind of weapons cult within the entertainment media.&quot; <font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Surette1998">Surette</a>, 1998,
    p. 54)&nbsp; </font>I believe it has also contributed to a preference for the use of force
    against gangs and the use of
    violence by the gang members as well. The lyrics of <a href="../Orientation/perspective.htm#Music"> gangsta rap</a>
    reinforce this penchant for violence and the gun.</p>
    <p>I sometimes think that if we spent as much time, effort, and money on
    designing effective education and treatment programs for youthful offenders
    as we do on designing new prisons and new weapons to fight crime, we might
    actually reduce gang activity and youth violence.</p>

    <p>If the public perception of gangs is inaccurate, policies designed to
    address the gang situation based upon
    that perception are likely to fail. If the perception of gangs is that <b> their members are
    mostly African-Americans</b>, then we overlook the tragedies occurring in Hispanic,
    Asian, Russian, Samoan, and other ethnic enclaves in cities throughout
    America. If the perception is that <b> all gang members are male</b>, then we
    overlook policies needed to help females stay out of gangs.</p>
    <p>If our perception is that <b> all gang members are violent</b> and are
    &quot;packing&quot; or &quot;strapped&quot; (carrying a gun), then we will support the use of force
    in dealing with them. The police will have permission to apply the
    screws. The problem is that not all gang members are
    violent or armed. As discussed 
    <a href="GANGS/getting_out_of_a_gang.htm#violence">earlier</a> in <i>Into the Abyss</i>, acts of violence by a gang
    sometimes lead some gang members to leave the gang.</p>
    <p>If we think that <b> all gangs and their members are into drugs</b> and that
    <b>the drug problem is a gang problem</b>, then we not only overlook the tens of
    thousands of gang members who are not into drugs, we also overlook  the drug dealers who are not gang members.</p>
    <p>The image of gangs created by the media is not accurate. I'm
    no different than anyone else and my own experience, as you have seen, was
    that the image I had of gangs wasn't even close to the reality of the
    situation. It
    is the inaccurate image, however, which informs public opinion and lays the foundation for
    our social policies towards gangs. It is no wonder that our
    current policy of suppression (arrest and incarcerate) hasn't been
    effective. The image created by the media is that the individual gang
    member is the problem, not the product of the problem. <b>The gang problem has
    been incorrectly defined, so our solutions are doomed to failure.</b></p>
    <p>Social policy on how to deal with gangs and their members must be based
    on a rational assessment of each community's local situation. The media do not
    contribute constructively to this understanding when they sensationalize
    gang-related events. On the other hand, when the media undertake to
    provide documentaries and other thoughtful programs, their efforts can
    contribute to reducing gang activity. This pro-social aspect
    of the broadcast and print media should not be overlooked. It should be
    encouraged and strengthened.</p>
    <p>Media programs which focus on the reality
    of the gang situation in specific communities may stimulate the public
    to support or develop appropriate policies including all <i> three</i> approaches to
    the gang situation - prevention, intervention, and suppression.</p>

    </font>has a good understanding of the paradox presented by media portrayals
    of gangs. She asks &quot;Is it educational or harmful to publicize
    gangs?&quot; to which she replies:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>On the one hand, youth gang activity is news and, as
      such, is considered suitable for reporting on television and in print.
      News stories are the method by which the public becomes informed about a
      social issue. In order to solve a social problem, the public needs to know
      that it exists, what the extent of the problem is, and the way in which it
      affects society.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>On the other hand, publicity about youth gangs can
      make them attractive to young people living in gang-infested areas. The
      publicity enhances their reputation for violence; this, in turn, can
      encourage them to engage in further violence. Furthermore, movies and
      dramas, in trying to create an interesting story, often romanticize gangs,
      distorting the truth by portraying gang members as adventure-loving
      outlaws, instead of dangerous, violent criminals. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Gardner1992">Gardner</a>,

    <p>Some refer to the situation with the media saying &quot;If it bleeds, it
    leads,&quot; meaning that only the goriest of stories capture the attention
    of the media. The public needs more than that. The media, generally speaking, seem unwilling to tackle the larger issues
    surrounding gangs - racism, ethnic hatred, limited opportunities, poverty,
    slums and public housing, segregation, poor schools, inner-city
    deterioration,
    political disenfranchisement, substance abuse and addiction, child abuse,
    single parenthood, and a loss of hope. Yet, those are the
    very forces that have contributed to the formation of gangs in the United
    States and the conditions which must be altered to produce a long-term
    reduction in gang activity and youth violence.</p>
    <p>We'll explore a variety of steps the mass media could take to reduce gang
    activity in the <i>Solutions</i> section of this book. Our next topic,
    however, is the response of the American justice system to the gang
    situation.</p>
