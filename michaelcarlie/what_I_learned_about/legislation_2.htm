    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The <a name="Creation"> Creation</a> of
    New, Gang Focused
    Legislation</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"> As the gang situation in our nation has worsened, new gang-specific laws have been
    created at municipal (city), State, and Federal levels. Municipal ordinances
    have been created to deal with gang-related activity and include curfew
    restrictions, noise abatement, and penalties for creating graffiti -  an
    act of vandalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> 
    Chicago's anti-gang loitering ordinance is another example of how recently
    developed municipal legislation is being used to deal with gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>Our Department's [Chicago Police
    Department] enforcement of the
    [city] Anti-Gang
    Loitering Ordinance has brought much-needed relief to neighborhoods held
    hostage by street gangs. Over the last two years, our officers have made
    31,000 dispersals and more than 37,000 arrests under the law.</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>I am convinced that our energetic enforcement of
    this ordinance contributed to the 25 percent reduction last year in
    gang-related homicides and the 13 percent decline in the number of homicides
    involving victims under the age of 21.</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>As importantly, our enforcement of the ordinance
    has helped to reduce the level of fear and intimidation in neighborhoods
    menaced by the constant presence of gangs. Removing gang members from our
    streets sends a powerful message to law-abiding residents that their
    neighborhoods belong to them, not to the gang-bangers.</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>That message is further reinforced when we impound
    the vehicles of persons found to be carrying weapons or illegal drugs in our
    neighborhoods -- as we did on more than 2,100 occasions last year alone.</b></font><font color="#008000" size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Rodriguez1998">Rodriguez</a>,

    <p align="left">The Institute for Intergovernmental Research estimates that
    over seventy percent of all states in the United States have  enacted
    some form of legislation pertaining to gangs. <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#IIR2000a">Institute
    for Governmental Research</a>, 2000)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">The types of gang-related legislation most
    frequently encountered pertained to enhanced penalties and sentencing for
    gang activities; drive-by shootings; graffiti; gang activity and forfeiture;
    and gang member recruitment.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Legislation designed to address gang activity
    continues to evolve. In 1999, new categories of legislation specific
    to gangs included carjacking, expert testimony, law enforcement training,
    and school dress codes/uniforms.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Public nuisance laws around the United States
    are increasingly noting gang activity as a factor in determining a nuisance. Indiana has defined real estate/dwellings as &quot;psychologically affected
    property&quot; if they are the location of criminal gang activity. This factor must be disclosed, by law, in real estate transactions.</font></b><font size="2"><b>&quot;</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#IIR2000a">ibid.</a>,

    is based upon the RICO model using various crimes &quot;as the basis for
    sentence enhancements and provide[s] for civil forfeiture of a street gang's
    assets and the proceeds of its criminal activities. Some States have added
    drive-by shooting statutes. STEP Acts can be valuable because they turn
    specific intent crimes like attempted murder or aggravated assault into
    general intent crimes.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">Johnson,

    <p align="left">Like the difference between proof beyond a reasonable doubt
    and proof by a preponderance of the evidence, the difference between <i>
    specific</i> and <i> general</i> intent is important. To find someone guilty of a
    crime using specific intent it must be shown that the accused meant to commit
    the crime. A person who purposely murders or assaults a person they
    selected as a victim may be found guilty with specific intent.
    </p>
    <p align="left">On the other hand, a person who murders or assaults a person they had no specific intent of murdering or assaulting may be found
    guilty with general intent. A drunk driver who hits and kills a pedestrian
    may be found guilty using general intent. The driver knew being drunk an
    driving could result in death, but the victim was not someone the driver
    intended to kill.
    </p>
    <p align="left">A finding of specific intent is <i> more
    difficult to achieve</i> than is general intent. Thus, being able to find
    a gang members guilty of a crime using general intent increases the
    likelihood of their conviction. This makes the STEP act particularly
    attractive to police and prosecutors when dealing with gang members.

    <p align="left">Combating gangs in America has become a dangerous, time
    consuming, and difficult task. The Safe Streets Act was passed in
    order to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement's efforts in this regard
    and to expand their intelligence about gangs. Through the use of the
    related Safe Streets Task Force units, law enforcement has been more productive
    in arresting gang members.</p>
    <p align="left">As Director of the United States Federal Bureau
    of Investigation, Louis Freeh provided an instructive statement to Congress concerning the relationship between the Safe Streets Act and gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">One of the most disturbing crime trends
    facing our country is the increase of violent street gangs--often made up of
    juvenile offenders. The rise of gangs and the violence perpetrated by these
    organizations are of grave concern. These organizations are no longer only
    in our urban centers--they are appearing in suburban neighborhoods, rural
    areas and small towns.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2"> Fighting these gangs cannot be left to individual law
    enforcement agencies. The &quot;Safe Streets&quot; initiative has a
    coordinated approach. These Safe Streets Task Forces are made up of teams of
    federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">The initiative is designed to allow the
    Special Agent in Charge of each FBI field division to address street gang
    and drug related violence through the establishment of FBI sponsored, long
    term, proactive task forces focusing on violent gangs, crimes of violence,
    and the apprehension of violent fugitives.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">There are 164 Task Forces operating in 52 of
    our field offices. These Task Forces team nearly 785 FBI Special Agents with
    nearly 142 other Federal Agents and some 1,255 state and local law
    enforcement participants. Since the beginning of this program, there have
    been almost 159,960 arrests and over 56,000 convictions or pre-trial
    diversions.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">In 1998, one of the major Safe Streets
    operations was carried out by FBI Special Agents and police officers in Los
    Angeles and Little Rock against the drug trafficking operations in both
    cities of a large gang, the Grape Street Crips. Fifty-six indictments were
    issued in Little Rock and 17 in Los Angeles. The arrests also disrupted drug
    trafficking in four other cities: Minneapolis, Cleveland, Jackson, and
    Memphis.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Another major case was Operation Crown, in
    which the FBI and the New York City Police Department targeted the entire
    top echelon of a major gang, the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation, and
    arrested 94 members and associates. The investigation focused on trafficking
    in firearms and drugs, and the felony charges against the defendants ranged
    from weapons and narcotics possession to conspiracy to commit murder.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Successes are taking place across the
    country as law enforcement agencies join together to make communities safer
    for all. One of the major successes was in Connecticut. In Bridgeport and
    Hartford, two Safe Streets Task Forces, composed of seven FBI Agents and 15
    police officers representing ten agencies, committed their investigative
    efforts and resources to an investigation involving the criminal activities
    of the Almighty Latin King/Queen Nation (ALKQN) and the Los Solidos (LS)
    street gangs.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2"> These investigative efforts required the use of court-approved
    electronic surveillance, focusing on the leadership and members of the two
    street gangs [and] culminated in the arrests and indictments
    of over 50 ALKQN and 52 LS members and associates.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Sixteen ALKQN and eight
    LS members were charged under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
    Organizations (RICO) statute, to include 13 homicides. These were the first
    prosecutions that utilized the RICO statute for gang members in Connecticut.
    Furthermore, the incarceration of these gang members had a measurable effect
    in reducing the violent criminal activity in these communities as reported

    <p align="left">Existing and new municipal and state laws and their
    enhancements, in addition to the RICO, STEP, and Safe Streets Acts have
    become a significant arsenal of legal tools now used by police and
    prosecutors in their dealings with America's gang members.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Some <a name="Difficulties">Difficulties</a> Related to
    Gang-Oriented Legislation</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">There are some difficulties still apparent in the legal
    apparatus used to arrest and convict gang members. As will be seen in the
    section on <i>Prosecutors, Courts and the System</i>,
    it is sometimes difficult to prove gang membership or affiliation or that a
    given group of individuals is a gang. It's all in the way in which the
    statute defines such terms and in the quality of the investigation of the
    crime, gang members, and the gang by police and prosecutors.</p>
    <p align="left">In addition, some prosecutors (and police) would like to have access to the
    juvenile records of adult gang members. In many states this is not
    allowed. Also, legislation dealing with juvenile offenders is
    sometimes outdated and, by some accounts, too lenient in dealing with today's more
    violent juvenile offenders.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b> Gang members, especially juveniles, sometimes pass through the
    system without serving any sentence. Problems that have always existed
    within the juvenile justice system make gang prosecution especially
    difficult because so many gang members today are juveniles.&quot; </b></font><font size="1">

    Webster, and Connors</a>, 1995, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/pgang.txt">page</a>)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Prosecutors
    expressed frustration with the effectiveness of the juvenile justice system
    in handling juveniles involved in gang crimes. Where criminal justice
    officials contend with a shortage of detention facilities, juveniles - even
    those with prior convictions - may receive only intensive probation for a
    felony charge.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b> In such a situation, sentencing enhancements and stricter
    penalties will have little effect on the gang problem. State juvenile codes
    were not designed for the serious violence that characterizes contemporary
    street gang crime, and the gang statutes almost completely overlook
    juveniles.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b> Often, the prosecutorial response to this difficulty is to seek
    transfer of serious juvenile offenders into adult court and correctional
    systems. But such transfers may be very difficult to obtain because of
    strong traditions favoring adjudication and treatment of juveniles within
    the juvenile court and corrections systems.</b></font>&nbsp; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">ibid.</a>,

    As we will see when we look more closely at the relationship between gangs
    and police, prosecutors, and probation and
    parole officers, there are limited resources for dealing with the gang
    situation. Efforts to use the many laws described
    above requires resources such as time, money, and personnel.&nbsp;
      </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left">
    <font size="2"><b> Once cases reach the courts,
    prosecutors are often frustrated with several factors that hamper the
    prosecution of gang members. Though it appears that sentencing enhancements
    might lessen the recycling of gang members through the criminal justice
    system, the State's resources must be considered in pursuing such
    enhancements.&nbsp; </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">ibid.</a>,

    <p align="left">According to the National Alliance of Gang Investigators
    Associations (NAGIA), &quot;Increased awareness of gang activity has led to a
    proliferation of municipal, state and federal gang-related legislation with varying
    degrees of effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> There is a need to identify and track
    legislation pertaining to gang prevention and suppression issues and to
    provide well-informed guidance to legislative sponsors. There is also a need
    to catalog and evaluate existing legislation to provide examples of
    beneficial statutes to those seeking to shape new legislation.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NAGIAaddress">National
