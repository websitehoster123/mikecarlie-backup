    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">A <a name="Professional"> Professional</a> Counseling Office</font></b>
    </p>
    <p align="left">I visited the office of two therapists who have counseled gang youth
    individually and as a group. Victoria Carrico and Graham Horst are
    husband and wife and have been professional therapists for over a
    decade. They are the primary providers of counseling services for gang
    members sent to their firm by area probation and parole officers. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Carrico is a detoxification specialist and an expert at
    substance abuse intervention. She is a recovering alcoholic (16 years sober) and knows
    from whence she speaks. I asked Carrico to describe her gang clients for me.
    &quot;Gang clients
    are always resistant to counseling. Any 'Mr. Happy' is simply in
    denial. I'm supposed to be a positive reinforcement for them. I
    usually start our sessions with a question.&nbsp; I ask them 'What do
    you want to do while you are in counseling?' and they say a variety of
    things. Usually they say they want to stay in their gang but that they'd
    like to reduce their drug use. The young ones, in particular, want to
    reduce their drug use.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I asked her why some youths join a gang. In what seemed like one breath
    she said &quot;Their
    dad did prison time, the home is broken, they feel like a nobody, no one
    stood up for them, they are always abused - either physically, sexually,
    verbally or emotionally, or they were neglected. Their moms are on
    drugs, they're school drop outs, they have no degrees, most have been in a
    boy's home and some did time. They are throw away kids.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I was stunned. She's seen so many gang members, and they've shared so much
    in common, that the list was apparently on the tip of her tongue. The list also
    confirmed everything I had been hearing and seeing for the past two years.
    </p>
    <p align="left">When counseling gang clients, Carrico said she tries to &quot;get the angry, defensive gang member persona
    put aside so I can talk with the hurt, scared person inside. I tell them that, in a way, they were set up to be sent here.
    You know, they had no controls at home. So I ask them 'When do <i> you</i> want to take
    control?' They aren't under control so
    they look for control and find it in a gang. But it's a false sense
    of security in a gang because, if a gang member gets in trouble, the gang
    won't be there for them. That's been my experience in listening to
    their stories.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Carrico defines &quot;wannabes&quot; as &quot;misfits looking for a place
    to be.&quot; She finds gang members &quot;easy to identify. The way
    they sit and what they wear. The white gang member clients are the
    hardest to work with. They talk tough and try to be like and talk like
    Blacks. If a Black is in their group, they try to be like them. And they're all so skinny and eaten up
    by
    <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#meth">meth</a>.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I asked if she could do anything to help someone addicted to methamphetamine. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said.
    &quot;You have to ask yourself if it's
    progress to move from meth to alcohol. I have learned to accept the
    fact that, for my meth clients, progress may be defined as self-medicating
    with alcohol. After all, that brings about a major change in behavior
    in that they don't use the needle anymore, they had to change who they
    associate with and, overall, they made a change in their pattern of
    behavior. But they have to want to change.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Carrico told me child abuse is the &quot;only cause of gang
    affiliation I always find in my gang clients.&quot; I asked her if there
    was any hope for abused children. She believes that &quot;this is real
    hard for gang members. I think they'd have to move away from the
    family. And that means they may have to move away from the gang. They'd have
    to leave the gang clothes and signs behind. They need a change of playmates
    and playgrounds. But they have to <i> want</i> to change. I can't
    emphasize that enough!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    What kinds of changes are needed? &quot;I think there are
    several things which can bring about change,&quot; she said. &quot;First, they need
    self-disclosure. They have to admit, to themselves and others, that
    their family life is bad and that their response - joining a gang, violating
    the law, abusing drugs - is inappropriate and wrong. Then they must learn to
    make choices. It's important that they begin to see that they have choices of action to take and
they have the power to determine which action to choose.
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;One of the choices they have to make is deciding whether to come to counseling and
    pay
    for it or not come to us for counseling.&nbsp;We charge for our services. They could get free counseling elsewhere, but
    I don't believe it would be as good for them as compared to allowing us to
    work with them. They can decide to talk freely with us or withhold
    things. If they begin using drugs again they can decide whether to
    report the relapse to us or their probation officer or not. It is
    important that they begin to see they have choices of action to take and
    they have the power to determine which action to choose.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">She told me that among the other factors which help bring about a
    change in a client's behavior is the willingness of the therapist to become
    an ally to the client - someone who helps facilitate change. She also
    emphasized the importance of respect when she said that &quot;Respect is
    unfamiliar to them. They've gotten none from their family. In fact,
    they've learned that they are not to be respected. They need to know
    they are respected by people <i>outside</i> the gang. It wins them
    over!&nbsp;That's where <i>hope</i> is.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Carrico noted that &quot;For many of my gang clients, they missed their
    childhood. Instead of a childhood, they had to be the dad of the
    family. In almost every case, my clients' criminal behavior and use of
    drugs and alcohol are symptoms of a bad childhood.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I asked if she thought her community had a gang problem.
    &quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't know what the actual problem is
    but I hear about the drive-by-shootings and feel sad about that because I
    know these kids are scared little kids. They do what they learned from
    their parents.&nbsp;It's too easy to throw kids away today. Single
    parents and all that.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I asked if she knew of a solution.&nbsp; Something that would lessen the
    problem. &quot;Education, education, education,&quot; she repeated.&nbsp;&quot;We need to educate the community as to why children join gangs
    and there need to be more resources for families to go to when their child
    is acting out. More education for the kids hasn't worked - in the end, they
    will do what they see their parents doing - drinking, using illegal drugs,
    committing crimes, fighting.&quot;
    </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Graham Horst is an internationally certified drug counselor. He's
    spent the past two years counseling gang members. &quot;We focus on
    their life experiences,&quot; he said. &quot;Why they did what they did, about the decisions they have made
    in the past and what the consequences of them were. We look closely at the
    decision-making process they use and try to teach them new ways to make
    decisions. Rather than reacting to situations without thinking, we emphasize
    thinking first.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    We started talking about how a community deals - or fails to deal - with
    gangs. He said &quot;I think there are at least five different
    approaches to gangs a community may adopt. They may <i> deny</i> there is a problem
    and do nothing. Or, they may attempt to <i> prevent</i> gangs from forming or
    prevent specific youths from joining them. For existing gang members, or
    their associates, a community may try <i> intervention</i> and, for gang members who
    refuse to modify their behavior to be lawful, there is <i> suppression</i> - arrest
    and eventual incarceration. The most extreme approach would be <i> extermination</i>
    and may include life-long imprisonment without parole or imposition of the
    death penalty.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The reason that convicted gang members, among others, are sent to Horst is
    so they can be treated.&nbsp;I wondered about which interventions
    work successfully and asked him about that. He said &quot;Most of the
    successes we have seen are when the gang members are dealt with through the
    criminal justice system. They simply get tired of going through the process
    - arrest, jail, court, release, arrest, jail, court, release, etcetera. They
    get tired of that and begin to be amenable to counseling.&nbsp;I think
    suppression makes them take responsibility and become accountable for their
    behavior.
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;It's difficult to intervene because gang members don't have a lot of
    social support. Still, we try to change their decision-making process. I ask a client about what he wants to do with his life. 'Is what you
    are doing going to help you reach that goal?'&nbsp;It's important
    that he becomes accountable for his behavior.&nbsp;I try to help them learn
    from their past behavior. But, like I said, they have to be tired of
    being in trouble.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">In summarizing what causes a youth to join a gang, Horst said they are
    &quot;under socialized. They lack family structure - it's real chaos
    in their families. They don't know any other way! I have to work
    with them to show them how to structure their lives.&nbsp;For them,
    they write their own rules since no one else was writing them - which is
    what their parents were supposed to do. They need to be helped to
    understand what the rules are. What I do is like 'Joining the Human
    Race 101.'&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Horst's perception of the gang issue is tied to another
    issue. He said &quot;So much is dependent on substance abuse - that's
    why I get them as clients. And recovery is the key. They're
    getting in trouble because they are in relapse - they're abusing substances
    again. They are most likely to relapse when they get together with old
    friends who are still into substance abuse and gang behavior. The
    recovery process requires that they stay out of old and unproductive
    relationships and get new friends - people who are not into alcohol or
    other substance abuse.
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;My clients have a choice. They can say 'No' to participating in
    substance abuse - especially if they have other relationships.&quot; This confirms concerns
    expressed by other interview subjects who spoke of the need
    for positive support groups for gang members who want to get out of the gang
    life. &quot;Gang members don't have a lot of social support,&quot; he added. &quot;Humans are herd animals - they are dependent upon
    having other people in their lives.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I was intrigued by Horst's statement that the family life from which many of
    the gang members come was filled with &quot;chaos.&quot; I asked
    him to elaborate on that comment and he exclaimed &quot;It's the parents! Most
    of them didn't parent! They lack social skills and are part of the
    problem.&nbsp;I encourage my clients to move away from them. But the family
    members are economically dependent on everyone else in the family and the father is
    usually gone. What I find is that the child often
    has to become the parent!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Look, I'm working with the adult children of dysfunctional families. There
    is an irrational allegiance and unhealthy bonding between these family
    members. Individual boundaries are not recognized. I refer to
    this as 'enmeshment.' Everyone's problems become everyone else's
    problem to deal with.&quot;<br>
    <br>
 I asked if he had any hope for change in his gang member clientele. &quot;Occasionally,&quot;
    he replied.&nbsp;I asked him to tell me about a success story - about a
    gang member who got out of the gang life. After taking a few seconds
    to think about this, he said &quot;Well, success for a client can be having fewer
    violations than he had before counseling. If he was being arrested or was
    involved in an unhealthy episode weekly and, after counseling, that changed
    to once a month, that's success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;I had a gang member client who moved
    here from California. After he got into counseling he made a legitimate
    attempt to change. He has a job and he stays away from gang associates. He started in gangs when he was eight years old - it was all that he
    knew by the time I got him.&nbsp;The change is slow, but the desire was
    there. But I have a problem knowing whether my clients have been
    successful because I lose contact with most of them after the counseling is over.
    We don't have any follow-up.&quot;

<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Community">Community</a>-Based Services</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">As opposed to services provided to offenders who are
    incarcerated, services available in the community are referred to as community-based
services. They are typically supported by private and corporate contributions and a mixture of federal, state,
county, and/or municipal funds. The services they provide include
education/prevention and intervention with individuals who are already involved
in delinquent and/or criminal behavior. As mentioned <a href="PP/levels.htm#broker">previously</a>, probation
and parole officers send many their clients to these agencies for assistance.
In this regard, community-based services are an extension of treatment provided
by probation and parole officers.</p>
    <p align="left">Some community-based services are offered through non-profit organizations
that serve specifically defined populations. For example, one agency may offer assistance to those who need job- and life skills
training while another offers services to those who need substance abuse counseling,
and so on for each group of clientele with a different constellation of
treatment needs.</p>
    <p align="left">Observations in the field revealed that some communities with gangs had very
limited services due to the fact they were in denial about the gangs. Most of the communities I visited, however, had a wide range of services
including substance abuse intervention, counseling (family, marital, and
individual), child abuse detection and treatment, anger management and conflict
resolution classes, and literacy training. Only a few had employment
training and placement or provided assistance in residential placement. That seemed to be a major problem.
    Without a legitimate job, illegal behavior was likely.</p>

    <p align="left">Tyrone North is an ex-convict. Having left a life of crime, he is
    now the director of a drug treatment program in a city with 453,000
    inhabitants. Nearly 52% of the city's population is
    African-American. The program is licensed and has branches in several
    other cities. While interviewing probation and parole officers in this
    community I was told that the program he operates &quot;has been
    helpful.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The program offers a variety of services including individual and group
    counseling, family therapy, life skills training, and referrals for
    vocational training, employment and housing assistance, child care, and
    medical care. Services are offered seven days a week and clients may
    be in the program for up to two years.</p>
    <p align="left">According to North, &quot;The program is <i> not</i> very effective.&quot;
    There was no data available indicating whether clients passing through the program continued
    to abuse drugs or not. As he said, his own evaluation was based on the
    fact that &quot;I see the same faces coming through here again and again.&quot;
    I asked why he felt the program wasn't successful and he gave the

    While viewing the nightly toll taken by gang members on the street as they
    shot and stabbed one another, she developed an interest in and concern for
    gang members.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I asked Michaels what she had learned about gangs and gang

    a multitude of observations. Among the most

            &quot;There is little emotional stability in the lives of children at risk.&quot;<br>

            &quot;The kids and their parents seemed hopeless. They held

            &quot;When a gang member wants to get out of the gang, they find it very

    wishing to leave their gangs. Without a support group outside the gang
            it's hard to leave it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
            &quot;When asked to think about problems associated with being in a gang, few
            gang members recognize that negative things are happening to them
            - things like poor performance
    in school, getting a bad reputation among administrators and teachers in school,
    negative stereotypes by others in the community. They often
    say 'My gang isn't like that.'&quot;<br>
    <br>
            &quot;They sometimes don't realize their family members are no longer

            Later, as the one who

            threatened, the threatened boy stepped in front of his mother,

    <p align="left">Talking about gang members, Michaels said &quot;When they joined, they had
    already rejected many people outside the gang and probably were not close to
    family members. The gang became their new family and, in time,
    were the only people they associated with regularly or intimately. Getting
    out of the gang means cutting off all remaining meaningful contacts. Why would anyone quit under these circumstances? And, if a gang member does
    quit, who will be in their social world?&quot;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left"> I asked why there
    weren't more programs to encourage kids to quit gangs. &quot;No one
    cares enough,&quot; she said. &quot;The problem is not perceived as being serious enough,
    no solutions have been imagined and created, no one knows where to get the resources which may be needed,
    those who could help won't because they are fearful for their own security,
    and the problem is seen as being so overwhelming that no solution seems
    possible.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">As to the future, Michaels believes &quot;Bad parenting seeds bad parenting&quot;
    and she used this as a way of discussing the possibility that gang members
    are going to be parents. She held forth little hope that as parents they will raise healthy, socially responsible children.
    </p>
    <p align="left">At the end of our visit, Michaels told me about a social program she conducted
    with young children in the community. None of them claimed to be
    members of a gang. &quot;During the program I put some folders on a
    table. They each contained coloring paper and other projects for the
    kids. Some of the folders were green, others were red, and some were
    blue. When I had the children pick up the folders only the blue ones were taken.
    For another program I used colored M&amp;M candies. Only
    the red ones were taken.&quot; Colors.&nbsp;

    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Marsha Cartwright is the director of a middle-school-based treatment
    program for at-risk kids. According to Marsha, &quot;They're all at
    risk here.&quot; The school is one of 16 in this inner-city that offer
    after-school programming until nine in the evening. A school counselor was
    sitting in on the interview and said &quot;This is taking a toll on the teachers.
    They're the ones who stay here after school hours and provide the
    programming for the kids. And there's no extra pay for what they do. They do
    it because they believe it's the right thing to do.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Cartwright told me &quot;Kids love their gang with
    a passion. It gives them love, acceptance, caring and is always
    there for them. It's reliable ... not like what they have at
    home. There's a lot of nurturing from
    other gang members. O.G.s accept younger members whether the
    younger members are fat, skinny, ugly, beautiful, strong or weak as long as
    the young member shares and meets the objectives of the gang.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Cartwright once
    encountered a gang leader and confronted him about what he was doing to one of
    the young members of his gang. He replied saying &quot;You gave him to me
    so don't go criticizing me.&quot; She explained this to me as
    his way of telling her that she had failed in taking care of the child, as did
    the child's parents, school, church, and community. So the child came
    to the gang and the gang took care of him. &quot;The gang leader
    didn't create the problem,&quot; she said, &quot;the rest of the community did that.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">She told me the school sponsors trips for the students to movies, the theater,
    sporting events, horseback riding, picnics, and elsewhere. This is done as a
    proactive and preventive step. &quot;The school is doing what the parents
    and the children's families should be doing.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    While talking about how one goes about reducing gang activity, Cartwright suggested
    this can only be done &quot;with the involvement of the entire
    community. The community gets involved by making alternative
    activities available - things like transportation to events and the events
    themselves. Activities like Double Dutch [rope jumping] teams and competition, drug treatment
    programs, education and job training.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Cartwright, using Double Dutch as bait, drew a dozen or so
    young gang girls into a new life free of gang activity. Like others who work
    with gang youth, she had successes, although she never considered there were
    enough of them.</p>

    Emanuel Flores is the counselor at a predominantly Hispanic
    alternative school in a large metropolitan community. The school is
    nestled in the center of the community's Latino population and has, as its
    mission, &quot;Educating and empowering at risk youth to graduate and become
    effective, productive citizens through an individualized program of
    study.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Flores is Hispanic and described some of the negative experiences he has had with police
    in the community and some of the negative experiences he knows Mexican gang members have had
    with them. &quot;Police have been rude, offensive, hurtful and
    physically abusive towards Mexican gang members,&quot; he said. He
    felt that some of the police were racist in their attitudes toward Hispanics.
    </p>
    <p align="left">While in the field I heard several treatment workers say they had no
    desire to &quot;put the gang down, but to put down the negative behavior they exhibit.&quot;
    I asked Flores about this. &quot;This thinking is not correct,&quot;
    he replied. The
    gang <i>is</i> the problem, not just the negative and illegal behavior of its
    members.&quot; Flores doesn't accept the notion that one can stay
    in a gang, without criminal behavior, and have something positive come out
    of it.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">He believes the problem with gangs is the &quot;gang <a name="mentality"></a>
    mentality&quot;  they foster in youths who already had that mentality when they
    joined. Flores defined gang mentality as &quot;The
    value system that each gang member holds and shares with fellow gang
    members. It is in opposition to general society's value system. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;The gang value system supports negative attitudes towards society's laws and
    holds in high regard those who violate them. It supports the
    belief that the individual is more important than the whole and that, if a
    given action does not benefit the individual, it is not worth doing. On the
    other hand, it is ethnocentric and sometimes fosters group loyalty. It is
    the way in which gang members look at the world.
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;The problem with the police is the way in which they go
    about interacting with gang members - being rude, offensive, overly
    aggressive - <i> that</i> is the problem. When they behave that way they are asked to leave
    by the Hispanic adults in the community. When there's another reason to call
    the police, they return with even more aggression.&quot;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Flores pointed out that Mexican participation in the American labor force is among
    the highest of all ethnic groups in the United States, something which flies
    in the face of a stereotype of Hispanics as lazy. He attributes their work ethic to the fact they
    are usually Catholic and that &quot;A piece of the philosophy of
    Catholicism is hard work.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Flores said &quot;We [Hispanics] live parallel lives with general
    society but the paths of the two never cross. We live near one another but
    there is little meaningful interaction between us. This had made the
    situation a problem with Hispanic youth who want to be included. Instead, they feel
    unwelcome.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">He believes that,
    among gang members, &quot;Anti-social behavior is romanticized. One is not 'bad,'
    he is a 'bandit' ... 'Robin Hood' ... the 'Underdog.'&quot; He believes Mexican gangs in
    this community, &quot;are a not-so-well-organized gathering of youths whose
    primary purpose for existing is to protect their turf, drink beer and get
    girls pregnant. It's all an expression of <i>machismo</i> - of being a 'man!'&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">What the school is trying to do is to raise the students' level of
    education and to foster in them the belief that they can make a positive
    contribution to the community. The program discourages gang activity by
    alerting students to the dangers involved in joining a gang.

    <p><b><font color="#008000">Program #1</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"> Jeanne Keller is the director of a federally funded
    anti-youth violence and anti-gang program located in the
    center of African-American gang territory in a community of
    nearly one-half million people. The program is designed to reduce youth violence and gang activity in
    the local neighborhood. There are other programs in the area which attempt
    to aid wayward youth, among them services provided by the State Division of Youth Services
    and the Division of Family Services. &quot;They're a mess,&quot; Keller
    said. &quot;They're a part of the problem, not
    part of the solution. They're understaffed, underpaid, and overworked. They
    really don't have time for these youths.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">When asked if her program was reducing gang activity and
    youth violence Keller said &quot;Gangs are a lure for neighborhood youth. For
    our program to work
    it must offer caring, acceptance, job training, education and lots of
    activity.&quot; There was no hard data to show that the program was
    either a success or a failure.</p>
    <p align="left">The gang members Keller talks with tell her they want a legitimate job.
    But, according to Keller, the youths have &quot;too few job skills, a poor or no work ethic,
    poor work habits, and their expectations for pay are too high. They think they
    deserve to start at $20 an hour! One of the things our program tries to do is teach
    youth to be smart in seeking employment. For example, hospitals pay
    about $12 an hour for janitorial work whereas McDonalds pays only $5 for the same
    work.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A few years ago Keller lived in a area of town known for its gang
    activity. She was exercising outdoors one day and witnessed some children breaking
    into a car. She yelled &quot;Get out of there!&quot; and, instead of
    running, one of the children aimed a shotgun at her as he and his friend
    starting walking toward her. &quot;Everyday,
    when I left home for work,&quot; she said, &quot;I was approached by youths and asked if I wanted
    to buy some drugs.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">She left the neighborhood permanently when, one night, there was a problem which drew
    &quot;fifty or sixty patrol cars. A high ranking police
    commander was at the scene and told the youths who had gathered to disperse.
    The
    youths told him to 'Fuck off!' and, rather than do something about them,
    the police tolerated the verbal abuse. At that point I realized the
    gang members were in control and no longer respected the police. Order
    in the community was destroyed.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">At the conclusion of the interview my impression was that the
    program was working reasonably well for youths who were not gang
    affiliated. But the gang affiliated youth presented a genuine
    problem. Their attachment to the gang, and the lack of a non-gang
    oriented support group while not in the program, erased any good which had
    been accomplished while in the program.

    <p><b><font color="#008000">Program #2</font></b>
    </p>
    <p align="left"> Milton Dennis is a
    veteran gang counselor and Director of a federally funded anti-youth
    violence and anti-gang program in a large West Coast city. The clientele with whom
    he works are primarily
    Asian - Cambodians being the largest group. Born in the United States,
    they are the children of native Cambodians. The clients are a mix of
    gang- and non-gang members who are all involved in delinquency or are at-risk
    for such behavior.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There's a language barrier between these youths and their parents,&quot;
    he told me. &quot;Because of this, the parents are not credible to their
    children. The children say 'What do you know!' when responding to
    attempts by their parents to control them.&quot;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Using a native-born Cambodian staff member, the program attempts to
    instill some of Cambodian culture into its offerings in hopes of creating an identity for the
    clients. The staff member feels &quot;They are lacking a
    meaningful self-identity and that is part of their current problem of trying
    to fit into our local community.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;One of the programs most significant features is our community
    room,&quot; Dennis told me. &quot;We use it for classes and for
    after-school and weekend programs for our clients. It's a place to
    meet and it's large and light. It's a nice place to be for
    them.&quot; On several occasions he said &quot;The kids who come here
    regard our center as their second home.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">He used the phrase &quot;second home&quot; on several occasions. He considers the
    program unique in the city for this reason. &quot;The other programs
    have a center, but they don't provide space for the kids to just hang out and have positive adult role models
    around. Instead, they have a place to do some sport or something like that.
    Nothing where they just hang out.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Although 11% of the city's population is from southeast Asia, the
    neighborhood in which the program is located is seventy percent southeast Asian and
    &quot;There is an abundance of public housing and lots of single mothers,&quot;&nbsp;according
    to Dennis.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I asked if gang activity in the area was decreasing. &quot;I think it is,&quot;
    he said, &quot;but the
    local and national evaluators [of his program] missed the most important aspects of the
    program when they came through for our most recent evaluation. It's a
    debacle! There are two goals that have been set for our program. First, we are
    to develop programs that fill in the gaps in services for these at-risk kids.
    Where there's a need and no program, we're supposed to fill the gap.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;Second,
    we are responsible for 'system reform or change.' That means we are supposed
    to look at the larger programs and bureaucracies serving clients like ours
    and try to help them find ways to do their work which are more effective. If we fail to do these two things, and do them well, then we are evaluated
    poorly. The difficulty with this is that those larger organizations include agencies at
    city, county and state levels. They include The Division of Youth
    Services, the Department of Health, County probation, Juvenile Services,
    corrections, police, the city's Housing Authority, and on and on.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left"> &quot;Some of
    these bureaucracies are hard to change. But that's one of our required goals and we
    have been very effective, particularly with the county agencies. About
    the only way we were able to convince the other agencies of the need for
    change was due to our having money. If we saw a need for a new program, we
    could help pay for it.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">As to the second goal, reforming or changing the larger organizations
    that work with the gang situation, Dennis said &quot;There are two focuses
    in the reform area. First, either we build a bigger youth detention
    center or we put more money in the front end and do gang prevention. The second focus is on correcting the disproportionate minority
    confinement policy that seems to be at work in this city. A
    disproportionate number of southeast Asian youths, African-Americans, and
    other minorities are arrested and prosecuted. We'd like to see this
    changed.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I told Dennis I was going to be riding with the city's police gang unit. He told me to be sure to ride with a certain officer, one who serves
    in the Asian-Emphasis gang unit. &quot;He's called Buddha by the
    southeast Asian kids here and they hate him. He's very rough with them
    and intimidates them all the time. We have a tenuous relationship with the
    police gang unit. There's so much intimidation, and they do it with kids that aren't
    really the problem. That <i>officer</i> is the problem.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Dennis gave me a copy of a recent newspaper article describing the
    problematic way in which the police are handling the Asian children in the
    community. The article described how the police gang unit was dealing
    with Asian gang members and focused on Buddha's behavior. The author took a decidedly critical position
    regarding police behavior.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Dennis used this story as a segue to an explanation of his latest
    achievement - dismantling one of the largest gangs in the program's
    neighborhood. &quot;We found jobs for the oldest members. That was
    easy,&quot; he said. &quot;They were tired of the gang life style. The
    sixteen to twenty-one year olds were selling drugs because they needed
    money. Some of them were arrested and locked up and the others have
    continued to sell drugs as individuals - not as a part of the
    gang. The younger members, kids twelve to fifteen years old, are here, at
    the Center. The very youngest are still in school.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I was fascinated to find that, given that gangs sometimes age grade their
    membership, Dennis' approach was to offer different solutions for each of
    the age groups in the gang. &quot;And,&quot; he said proudly,
    &quot;it worked!&quot;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Among the things Dennis learned while working with gangs over the past
    twelve years were that &quot;Prevention is much more effective where gangs
    are not intergenerational or highly organized. And when a gang is broken up,
    the one-time members are vulnerable to attack by rival gang members.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Dennis believes the organization he's working for needs to stay
    small. There are currently six fulltime employees. He directs, counsels,
    writes grant applications, and more. The agency is in the process of hiring
    several more people and he knows they are going to need an executive
    assistant. &quot;The bigger we get the more out of touch with our
    clients we become and I don't want that to happen. The kids who come
    here really enjoy the staff because we know them and we show how much we
    care.&quot; This need for one-to-one contact between troubled youth and positive adult
    role models was <a href="#mentoring">mentioned</a> by several practitioners
    during the period of my research.

            [Asian organized crime]. As we entered, I was struck by the number

            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">The officer told me &quot;A man was
            murdered at the club a few months ago. I want to show you the
            card room where he was murdered. He was involved in a card
            game. When we went in we found a man coming out and searched
            him. He had $80,000 dollars on him - cash!&nbsp; Must have
            been quite a game.&quot;</font></b></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">We entered the room and looked
            around. &quot;Well, I guess you had to be there that
            night. The atmosphere in the room, you know.&quot; I looked in a corner of the room and saw a computer and some CD recording
            machines. As I approached the equipment I could tell it was
            used to make copies of commercial music CDs. It was a CD pirating
            operation.</font></b></p>
            <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><b>That explained the CD covers I
            saw posted on the walls. The CDs were being sold at the bar for $10 each. But they were illegal copies costing
            only fifty cents each to make (a box of 1,000 blank CDs was found
            next to the computer with a receipt for $500).<br>
            <br>
            While we were looking at the equipment one of the employees came
            into the room. He introduced himself as a busboy and asked
            &quot;What are you doing in here?&quot; The officer questioned
            him about the equipment and the young man said &quot;I use it to
            make copies of CDs I want.&quot;&nbsp;He was asked who owned it and
            said &quot;I own it, well, I use it.&quot; The officer later
            told me the man said he owned it to take the onus off the real owner
            - the proprietor of the pool hall and a local member of the Triad.</b></font></p>

            Asian organized crime makes money - they'll do it any way they
            can.&quot; The equipment was seized and taken to the police
            station. While packing it into a police van the officer told me
            &quot;Nothing very serious is going to come from this. Our
            laws, the courts, are so lax. There'll be little
            punishment and the equipment will be replaced in days.&quot; I
            estimated the cost of the equipment at about $12,000 to which he
            said &quot;That's pocket change to these guys.&quot;</b></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    Talking about the pool halls

    Among the services brokered are getting utility bills paid, family and

    <p align="left">This program is an example of many operating throughout the United States
    whose purposes are education, delinquency prevention and keeping
    youths from joining gangs. There is little direct,
    hands-on, treatment or intervention with either delinquent or gang
    youth. If you accept the notion that education and prevention are a
    more meaningful long-term answer to the gang situation, then you know how
    important programs like this are. If they do nothing more than
    &quot;keep good kids good&quot; they have done the community a great
    service.

    <p align="left">Russell currently has three youthful clients. One was a gang
    member but couldn't
    get out of his gang due to rival gang intimidation. Russell chose to
    send that youth out of his neighborhood to receive job training. &quot;That worked, but we were lucky.
    He was able to find
    transportation to the training site.&quot; While discussing another gang member client, Russell said &quot;I look at
    gangs like a triangle consisting, mostly, of wannabes at the bottom of the
    triangle- the
    most problematic and important group. Then there are the active
    participants in the middle and, at the top, the hard core gang leaders. If
    prevention is going to work, it is with the wannabes. They have to be
    steered to legitimate activities and we have to focus on their home life,
    especially the twelve to fourteen year olds.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Getting in to a gang is easy today,&quot; he said. &quot;It's
    not so much being <a href="GANGS/join_a_gang.htm"> sexed in, beat in</a>, or having to commit a crime as it used
    to be. Today, among the gangs, its the number of members that counts -
    bigger is stronger - so getting in is relatively easy. Getting out, on the other hand, is
    difficult.&quot; There wasn't much he felt his agency could do to help
    gang youths do that.

      Richardson, Anti-Gang Treatment Program Director)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Trent Richardson is a black ex-convict. He was convicted on a
    murder charge and served nine years in a state penitentiary. He was
    born and raised in the inner-city, committed his crime there and, upon
    release from prison about 26 years ago, moved to another community to start
    a new life. He now directs an anti-gang treatment program.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Richardson believes the local gangs are loosely organized and that many
    of them have been either drawn to the area or were created here due to the
    large market for crack cocaine. He sees most gang activity in
    the community as business-related (i.e., selling drugs, stealing) rather
    than being gang-related (i.e., true to colors, protecting gang turf,
    protecting gang members). &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">One aspect of Richardson's program involves monitoring local gangs and gang
    members and their graffiti as a means of determining what's going on in
    surrounding neighborhoods at any given point in time. Richardson fears there is a stereotype of all inner-city youth as members of one gang or
    another. He sees many youth who are not affiliated and some who try to look
    like they are simply for their own protection. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">When asked what his organization is doing to stem the tide of gangs he said
    &quot;Hardcore gang members are hard to change, but I prefer not to give up
    on anyone.&quot; His own story is a testament to having faith. He
    believes he was very difficult to deal with as a youth but, because a few people stuck
    it out with him, he eventually changed his way of thinking and his behavior.
    He recently hired one of the most hardcore gang members he knew as a means
    of gaining the respect of other gang members and to increase communication
    with them.
    </p>
    <p align="left">Richardson spoke with some passion about the relationship between gangs,
    drugs, and sexually transmitted diseases. &quot;Gang members sometimes
    have promiscuous and multi-partner sex without the use of condoms or other
    protection.&nbsp; And some gang members are sexed into the gang. Taking drugs intravenously also increases the likelihood of
    contracting a sexually transmitted disease.&quot; His concern had translated
    into offering free condoms as part of his agency's regular program.<br>
    <br>
    Richardson emphasized that he prefers to use only a few resources to try to
    reach the hardcore. &quot;I think we have to save most of the
    resources to help the young and to prevent their entrance into the gang
    life. Our program focuses its efforts and resources on preschool,
    elementary school, middle school and high school students. We offer
    life skills courses in the schools and several outreach programs to children
    outside the school. Among the outreach programs are anger management and conflict resolution.
    Our people try to present the same message over and over. This repetition is
    how one learns values that result in a child passing by the gang
    experience.&quot;

    his seventeen-year-old cousin when the cousin was sent to prison. He spoke of youths he knew who joined gangs as a means of being protected
    from their physically abusive fathers and of other children who joined
    gangs to get help in protecting their mothers against their
    abusive fathers.

 (Darrel Scott, Neighborhood Betterment Project Director)</font>
    </p>
    <p align="left">Darrel Scott is the director of an neighborhood betterment project
    located in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in a city with
    nearly 1,700,000 inhabitants.&nbsp;Scott, an African-American in his late 30's, spent eight years in prison for
    a crime committed when he was 16 years old. Referring to prison life
    as &quot;brutal,&quot; he escaped some of the brutality by burying himself
    in the prison's school and, by the time he was released on parole, had
    earned both a high school equivalency degree (G.E.D.) and a two-year college
    associates degree.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As a black male,&quot; Scott said, &quot;I thought that prison was a
    natural right of passage - certainly in my surroundings. &nbsp;My uncle and
    cousin were in prison ... it was my rite of passage into adulthood. I
    was in jail when offenders were put in holding tanks - you know, lots of men
    in one big cell. When we were fed it was all put in one place with no
    one's name on any of it. It was dog eat dog. But I know
    that prisons are necessary. There are certain people who should never,
    never, never be let out into society.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When I got out of prison I got a job driving a school bus in the
    afternoons. In the mornings I looked for other work and one thing led
    to another and now I'm here. I've been in this position for several
    years and I've had dinner with the Mayor and some of our state legislators
    and I was featured in a seminar in Washington, D.C.!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Through the betterment program, Scott facilitates groups in the community whose
    purpose is to bring about positive changes in the neighborhood and its
    people. Included in their activities is a graffiti clean up
    project.&nbsp;Scott believes the abandoned buildings in the neighborhood are
    symbolic of its gang situation. They are &quot;broken
    windows. They're symbols of the problems we have - people not caring
    for their property, no one taking time to fix things. It's a state of
    mind and it's the kind of thing that keeps a community down. It's a
    product of hopelessness and carelessness. The abandoned buildings
    attract drugs, prostitution, and other crimes, and many of the buildings are
    located close to our public schools.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Scott believes the community has &quot;lots of good programs, but too
    many children are being murdered. We need to focus less on the gangs and more on the root causes
    of gang formation and gang violence.&quot; One purpose of Scott's
    betterment project is to bring the rate of violence down in its neighborhood.
    The program accomplishes that, he said, &quot;by focusing on the schools and the family as
    well as the physical community - the buildings in our neighborhood, how our
    land is used, utilities, the condition of our streets and sidewalks, street
    lighting, and other city services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;Our project takes a shotgun approach to the gang problem [trying to do
    many things at once]. We
    work with another organization that provides an ex-gang member as a speaker
    in the schools and we offer activities for our local youths. We held a
    youth summit last summer for one thousand people. We invited some rapper groups to entertain and offered seminars on life skills and anger
    management. We even set up tables for local social service agencies
    and their materials.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">I asked Scott to tell me about the local police and their handling of the
    gang situation. The police department has 1,200 full time officers,
    nine of which are assigned to the gang unit. He said &quot;They're
    ineffective. The issue is how they label youths as gang members. They are
    too free with their stereotype of youths as gang members. For example,
    in our neighborhood there is a group of youths 'ten deep' [when they gather
    together, there are usually ten of them] which appears daily on a
    nearby street corner. Some of the individuals in it deal drugs and the
    group loiters, but it is not a gang and they would not call themselves a
    gang. The police call them a gang.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The police are mean. They're mean in their interactions with Latino
    and Black youths. They're racist.&quot; He offered examples of
    when Black and Latino youths were verbally and physically assaulted by the
    police. He told me he has witnessed some of these encounters.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Scott believes we should take the label &quot;gang&quot; out of the
    conversation and address the problem with greater accuracy. They way he
    described the situation, it's as though the concept of <i>gang</i>, and all
    the meanings it brings with it, gets in the way of dealing with the real
    problem - whatever it is that causes children to form, join, and
    participate in gangs. &quot;For example, if the children are selling drugs,&quot;
    he said, &quot;let's deal with that, not with whether they are in a gang or not.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    When asked about probation and parole officers and their approach to gangs, Scott
    said &quot;They are more innovative in their approaches, including their
    move towards stationing their officers and offices in
    the neighborhood.&quot; One of the more unique aspects of social
    services in this community is the establishment of neighborhood sub-stations
    where probation and parole officers, along with beat cops and a
    representative from the prosecutor's office, work at least one day a
    week. This is done for the convenience of the neighborhoods'
    residents.</p>
    <p align="left">Scott believes &quot;Probation and parole people are more conscious
    of what our neighborhood residents' lives are like. Our people are
    poor, the housing is bad, there's a lot of unemployment and underemployment,
    abandoned buildings, lack of city services, and more.&quot; It was clear to
    me that this program was less concerned with identify gang members and
    trying to &quot;treat&quot; them than it was with striking at one of the
    root causes of gang formation and trying to remove it - the deterioration of
    the physical infrastructure of the neighborhood and its correction through a
    mobilization of its residents.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Issues">Issues</a>
    Facing Community-Based Services</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">The following observations apply to the programs and
    services mentioned above as well as all the <a href="PP/levels.htm#services">other
    community-based social services I observed</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><b><a name="Compensation"><font color="#0000FF">Compensation</font></a></b></p>
    <p align="left">Salaries for the highest ranking positions in the agencies I
    visited were sometimes pitifully low when compared to the amount and quality of
    work the people in them were producing. Salaries for new employees
    paid for only the barest essentials to satisfy body and soul. Opportunities for promotion were scarce due to the fact that the agencies
    were not growing or not growing fast enough to satisfy the
    demand of those in the lower ranks to reach higher levels of responsibility
    and pay.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><a name="Funding"><font color="#0000FF">Funding</font></a></b></p>
    <p align="left">Most of the agencies were either insufficiently funded or the source of
    their funding was unstable. Usually it was both. Grants from government
    agencies, as well as contributions from caring individuals,
    businesses, and organizations, do not provide a stable platform from which
    to provide services. There is, instead, a constant state of stress
    produced in the agencies by the never ending search for funding and for
    increased funding as the client base they deal with increases.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><a name="Administration"><font color="#0000FF">Administration</font></a></b></p>
    <p align="left">Many of the agencies I visited, including those operated by
    state, county, and municipal entities, were suffering under poor
    leadership. Although some were exceptionally good at what they did, the norm was an
    almost numbing traditionalism that squelched the creativity and drive of its line workers.</p>
    <p align="left">Many of the agency personnel I visited were frustrated by
    the fact that they wanted to be able to do more but couldn't. They
    were, they said, crippled by heavy caseloads, insufficient resources, poor
    training, and ineffective, intrusive, or bothersome administrators.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><a name="Training"><font color="#0000FF">Training</font></a></b></p>
    <p align="left">Training for staff and administrators seemed
    insufficient. In several states, if any gang training was provided, it consisted of one or two hours and was only offered
    once in the career of the worker in question. On-going training - training after employment and throughout one's career in an
    agency - was
    practically nonexistent.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Barriers">Barriers</a> to Lasting Change</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">It was little comfort to find that, even if or when they
    could help a client, clients were typically shunned by the
    community. This is nothing new. &quot;Criminals&quot; have never
    been welcomed in a community, unless it was a community of other
    criminals. The labels of &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; and
    &quot;gang member&quot; result in the same rejection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Inter-Agency <a name="Cooperation"> Cooperation</a> and
    Coordination</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">There was a lack of cooperation and coordination among the
    various social service agencies in each community due, perhaps, to being in an environment
    of overwhelming demand for service and a corresponding lack of resources. An agency hoping to expand its services will likely encounter opposition
    from other agencies who feel threatened by their expansion. It's no
    wonder that much of the literature of social reform today is filled with
    pleas for cooperation and coordination among agencies.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Community <a name="Mobilization"> Mobilization</a></font></b></p>
    <p align="left">There's a great deal of talk about &quot;mobilizing&quot;
    communities to deal with at-risk, high-risk, and gang youth, as well for other
    issues. Mobilizing a community means raising the awareness of people
    in it about a given issue and moving them to take effective action. In order to do this, as Spergel<font size="1">
    (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Spergel1991">1992</a>)</font>
    tells
    us, &quot;The process depends on cooperation, 'cutting through' denial
    and apathy, as well as managing inter-organizational suspicion and conflict,
    so that the process leads to changes in awareness and improved response to
    the problem.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Spergel1991">Spergel</a>,
    1992, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/d0015.txt">page</a>)</font></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">In <a name="Closing"> Closing</a></font></b></p>
    <p align="left">Among the themes that ran through the interviews were:
    substance abuse; poverty and inner-city deterioration; single-parenthood;
    abusive relationships with parents; parental neglect and the corresponding attraction
    of the gang; the lack of positive adult role models and the abundance of
    negative ones; violence; juvenile irresponsibility; the leniency of the
    justice system, abuse by some of its practitioners, and a tendency to label
    youths as gang members too hastily; a need for education, job training,
    and job placement; a lack of positive support groups for juveniles wanting
    to get away from the gang lifestyle and substance abuse; a lack of community
    support; and racial/ethnic
    misunderstandings, stereotypes, and discrimination.</p>
    <p align="left">None of the agencies I visited had evaluation data on the
    success or failure rate of their clientele. In addition, none of the
    social service providers I interviewed were satisfied with the results their
    respective agencies were experiencing. &quot;Being successful in
    treating your clients&quot; is now defined as having clients who offended
    less often. While none of the interview subjects were happy with this
    circumstance, they seemed to have learned to accept it.</p>
    <p align="left">While some clients were benefiting from the services
    offered, others were not. There were a number of explanations for this
    failure including a lack of client motivation to change and limited access to
    good treatment programs (ones that were adequately funded, well
    administered, with well paid and thoroughly trained staff).</p>
    <p align="left">Perhaps the relatively high turn-over rate of employees in
    the social service sector can be explained, at least in part, by the factors outlined above
    (i.e., poor pay, limited advancement, inadequate administration, poor
    community response). It appeared to me that the communities I visited simply were
    not willing to pay more taxes or otherwise raise funds in an amount sufficient to assure
    that social service providers could serve local youth well.&nbsp;It was
    either that or the&nbsp; majority of those who vote are simply in a state of
    denial about the severity of the youth problem in their community.</p>
    <p align="left">The comments I heard about various state Division of Youth
    Service agencies was troubling. Rather than leave the general impression
    that all Division of Youth Service agencies are inadequate, I want to
    emphasize that the opinion expressed above are those of a minority of
    counselors and community-based agency directors. My own experience with
    several Division of Youth Service group homes for delinquency and gang youth
    has been very positive.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Despite all the troubles community-based services are
    having, the communities they serve are fortunate that so many of the people
    who work in them care about their clients and work very hard to help them
    help themselves. There are successes. We do not hear enough about them. And
    here are failures. We hear all too much about them.</p>
    <p align="left">This brings us to the end of what I learned about gangs and
    the response of various social institutions to them. The next section of <i>Into
    the Abyss</i> presents conclusions for each of the chapters up to this
    point.&nbsp;</p>
