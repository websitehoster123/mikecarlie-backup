    <p><a name="Communities">Communities</a> are a collection of neighborhoods. That way of
    viewing a community helped me understand some of what I was seeing in terms of
    gangs. Entire communities do not have gangs. Gangs are in them,
    but it would be more accurate to say that, for the most part, gang members
    live and operate in one or more specific neighborhoods in a community. They barely
    exist in other neighborhoods.</p>
    <p> I mentioned this distinction to a probation and parole officer who had a gang
    member caseload. She said &quot;That's not true. There are gangs everywhere in this
    city.&quot; I then asked &quot;What would a map of the city look
    like if you were to stick a red pin in it at the <i> place of residence</i> of every
    documented gang member in town?&quot; &quot;There'd be pins
    everywhere!&quot; she said. &quot;Would most of them be in any certain
    part of town?&quot; I asked. &quot;Well, yes&quot; she said with some
    hesitation. &quot;Most of them would be on the northeast side of town.&quot;</p>
    <p>Hans Werdmolder <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Werdmolder1997">1997</a>)</font>
    is a Dutch social scientist. In his study of gangs in the Netherlands he
    noted the significance of the neighborhood to its residents and to the
    formation of gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>In my view, the neighbourhood determines to a large
      extent the kind of accommodation the family will move into, what school a
      youth will attend and which friends he will meet. In other words,
      the neighbourhood strongly influences the process of integration and youth
      gang formation. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Werdmolder1997">Werdmolder</a>,
      1997, p. 8)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The distinction between a neighborhood and a community is critical
    when thinking about gangs. If a community has limited resources for dealing
    with gangs and gang members, why spread precious resources
    across the entire community when the situation that needs correcting lies
    mostly in one or two (or however many) neighborhoods? The people in
    those neighborhoods are in desperate need of help.</p>

    <p>The implications of the distinction between <i>neighborhood</i> and <i>community</i>
    are important for many reasons, one of them is related to research on gangs. Why <i> don't</i> certain neighborhoods have much in the way of gang members and
    gang activity? Isn't that an important question? Wouldn't the answer give us some
    insight as to why certain neighborhoods <i>do</i> have gangs?</p>
    <p>I think what we are seeing is that the social institutions in some
    neighborhoods are healthier than those in other neighborhoods. What I
    learned was that gangs are seldom found in neighborhoods where the social institutions with
    which we are
    concerned exist and are in good working order. If the family, schools,
    faith community, social services, health care and business communities,
    justice system, and local government are strong, gang activity is at a
    minimum.&nbsp;On the other hand, in neighborhoods or very small communities 
    where these social institutions were absent or weak, there was a greater 
    likelihood of finding gang activity.&nbsp; Look at your own community, is that what's happening?</p>

    <p>There's an important message in all of this - we should focus
    our attention and efforts on the neighborhoods described above and provide whatever
    assistance is needed in order to strengthen their weakened social institutions.
    I firmly believe healthy families are at risk when the other social institutions
    in their midst weaken.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If the family were seen as the seat on a three-legged stool and the three
    legs were each a different social institution (i.e., schools, the business
    community, and faith institutions), if any one of the legs fails, the family
    is disrupted. Weaken all three legs and the family is likely to collapse. I
    think that's what happened in gang-dominated neighborhoods and what led to
    their being dominated by gangs. Gangs become the legs for the neighborhood's
    children.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">In Closing</font></b></p>
    <p>Communities have a vested interest in maintaining denial. To accept
that there is a problem is an admission that &quot;something is wrong.&quot; But a community which accepts it has a
    gang presence in one or more of its neighborhoods need not see itself as somehow
    ill. Some neighborhoods
    are healthy, others are not. It's up to the entire community to
    repair or rebuild social institutions in the neighborhoods where they are
    weak. We
    become our greatest enemy when we fail to recognize this. And
    gangs prosper when we fail.</p>
    <p>We will explore some of the steps neighborhoods and communities may take
    to reduce gang activity when we explore solutions to gang activity and youth
    violence later in <i>Into the Abyss</i>. For now, I'd like to share what I
    learned about schools and how they are responding to the gang situation.&nbsp;</p>
