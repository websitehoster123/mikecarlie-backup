    <p>I interviewed a woman who was about 40 years of age. She looked
    like she was in her mid-50s. She had one child, a boy who eventually
    became involved in gang activity. He was recently beaten by two other
    members of his gang because he defaulted on a drug-related loan to them. They
    beat him so badly that steel plates had to be implanted in his skull to keep
    it from collapsing.</p>
    <p>She cried throughout the entire interview as she told of the way in which
    she was treated by her father when she was a child. It was a very sad,
    hour-long interview after which I understood why her son got involved in
    gangs. She had been beaten by her father and swore as a child
    that &quot;If I ever have children, I will not hit them!&quot;</p>

    <p>During the interview she said she believed her promise backfired when it
    came to matters surrounding her son. She never found a meaningful way to discipline him so, when he acted out,
    his behavior continued without restraint. He had become uncontrollable. He began associating with other aggressive
    children which, she felt, led to his gang involvement. In desperation,
    she now stands quietly on the sidelines crying and watching her son get in

    <p>Some children are having children. I remember reading an article in
    the mid-1980s in which the author stated that &quot;Every day in America,
    forty teen-age girls give birth to their third child.&quot; I don't
    know what happened to that article or who wrote it, but that statement has
    never left my thoughts. What quality of parenting or quality of
    life can be expected in a family in which the mother is a 15, 16, or 17 year
    old? Maybe successful parenting at such an early age was possible 50 years ago, but
    today, with the need to finish school and obtain work, the odds of raising
    a child successfully at such an early age are low.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>

      children join gangs, and the structural and racial barriers they regularly
      encounter.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Most participants lived in apartments (77 percent)

    <p>Brown interviewed African-American gang members and their parents or
    guardians. The desperation hinted at in Brown's research <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Brown1998">1998</a>)</font>
    - the loss of hope, the
    feeling that their children &quot;had no life chances outside the gang&quot;

    40 African-American women who were raising their children as single parents

    Angeles public housing project. One group consisted of 18
    mothers with children who were in gangs. The other group consisted of 22

    <p>Campbell asked the mothers of gang members in his study why their
    children joined a gang. &quot;Three of the top four items - <b>need to
    belong,
    to feel protected, and insecurity</b> - are strongly interrelated.
    These factors represent age-specific developmental needs of
    adolescents.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Campbell1992">ibid.</a>,
    1992, pp. 49-50)</font>&nbsp; Maslow's hierarchy is once again confirmed.</p>
    <p>Earlier in this book the relationship between conditions in the community
    and gang formation were explored. Some of those conditions are reflected in Campbell's findings as parents defer to
    <a href="GANGS/WHYFORM/economic_deprivation.htm"> economic conditions</a> in the
    inner-city as a leading cause of their child's gang involvement - using the
    gang as a means of deriving income.</p>
    <p>Observations of and interviews with gang members in their homes suggested their participation in a gang may also have resulted from the fact
    that they were raised by an <a href="GANGS/WHYFORM/family.htm"> incompetent single parent</a> - usually a female
    (sometimes the mother and sometimes an aunt or grandmother), or because there
    wasn't a <a href="GANGS/WHYFORM/family.htm"> positive adult male role model</a> in the home. 
    Instead, there
    was no male role model, the male role model was negative (i.e., abusive, a
    gang member, cold and uncaring), or there were a succession of males in the
    household which further angered, confused, or alienated the child.</p>
    <p>Some of the parents I interviewed expressed a genuine, albeit hopeless,
    concern about their child's involvement in gang activity. They knew
    their child was suffering. Milbourne, in his research on 19
    African-American, female-headed families with adolescent gang members, found
    that&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>... parental concerns regarding
      safety, impact of gang involvement on children's values, and impact of
      gang involvement on children's futures increased as the child moved from
      &quot;wannabe&quot; gang status to full affiliation. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Milbourne1990">Milbourne</a>,

    </blockquote>
    <p>George Knox, one of the few gang researchers who has dealt with the
    subject of gang member parents, tells us &quot;When the family provides
    for all the basic human needs of American youths, then we can safely say
    that the influence on youthful behavior from other sources such as the
    community will be negligible. But when the family does not provide for
    all of the needs of its children ... this weight of responsibility will have
    to be carried elsewhere to produce good citizenship, and if this burden of
    citizenship training is not taken up, then what we can look forward to is a
    greater probability of gang problems.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knox1994">Knox</a>,
    1994, pp. 392-393)</font></p>
    <p>One of the needs to which Knox alludes, addressed earlier as part of Maslow's &quot;Hierarchy
    of Needs,&quot; is for self-esteem. He refers to self-esteem using
    such terms as self-respect,
    autonomy, achievement, and status recognition. Parents who fail
    to create situations in which their children can develop positive feelings
    about themselves are hurting their children. According to Maslow, if all humans strive for self-actualization, they must
    first have self-esteem in
    order to achieve it.</p>
    <p>If self-esteem is not developed in the family, perhaps it can be developed in the school.
    If not in the school, then perhaps in
    faith institutions. If not in faith institutions, perhaps it can
    be developed in the neighborhood as good neighbors reward area children for
    their good deeds. If none of that happens, from what source will
    a child derive self-esteem? If nothing else, a gang can offer it.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">In Closing</font></b></p>
    <p>I'd like to close this section of the book with a quote from Knox's monumental <i>Introduction
    to Gangs</i> <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knox1994">1994</a>)</font>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>In the best of all worlds, the family as an agency of
      socialization and informal social control would be the best &quot;first
      line of defense&quot; against the gang problem. But dysfunctional
      families do exist, even more families experience enormous economic stress
      or feel the effects of residential segregation and failing relationships
      to other mainstream social institutions ... and these families might
      theoretically be expected to be less effective in instilling in their
      youths an internal &quot;buffer&quot; against joining a gang.&nbsp;</b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knox1994">Knox</a>,
      1994, p. 414)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>There is a need for more hard and quantifiable data
      on gangs in relationship to the family and the many factors involved with
      what we regard as &quot;family.&quot;</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knox1994">Ibid</a>.,

        The parents of gang members do not exist in a void. They are surrounded 
        by a neighborhood and community - albeit one that may or may not be in 
        very good condition. The next section of <i>Into the Abyss</i> offers 
        observations on the community and gangs.</p>
