they may have done nothing to deserve the anger being expressed. You don't have to hate these guys to work with them.

<p>By &quot;crossing the line&quot; I refer to gang unit officers who agitate
gang members and exacerbate the relationship between police and gang
members. Evidence of such behavior includes unprovoked yelling, name
calling, use of insulting or derogatory language, verbal threats, pushing,
hitting, and other assaults upon the person or reputation of a known or
suspected gang member. In some cases, it includes criminal acts by the police.</p>
<p>Among the incidents of crossing the line I observed was one in which the gang unit officer, a female, carried a
military-type knife that has a blade that is eight inches long and about two inches
wide. She wore it strapped to the top of her right thigh.&nbsp;You might <a href="perceptions_of_gangs.htm#Field">remember

he said.
&quot;Once the police see that the prosecutor isn't going to take their gang cases
seriously they sometimes get a little lazy and start to make mistakes
- like conducting searches without probable cause, harassing suspects, writing insufficient or sloppy
reports.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p>One of the situations I encountered involved a police gang unit with five
officers. The supervisor of the unit, having learned the county
prosecutor was not interested in prosecuting suspected gang members as members
of a gang, began roughing up gang members on the street. He violated suspects' due
process rights and assaulted them. The supervisor's activities were known to the prosecutor and, in time, the
chief of the police department was told by the prosecutor he would have to
bring the matter to court (by prosecuting the gang unit supervisor) if something
wasn't done to correct the matter. &quot;I was taken out of the
gang unit the next day,&quot; the supervisor told me. &quot;They
transferred me to a desk job in another unit in the department.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent several nights cruising with police gang unit officers in a West Coast American city.
One night we saw four youths spread-eagled on a patrol car. They had been
stopped by a patrol officer for a traffic violation and it happened to be in front of the apartment
in which one of the youth's lived. That youth's father was at the scene along with several other family members and a
few neighbors.</p>

<p>Two other gang unit officers arrived at the scene before we did and were
standing near the crowd when we arrived. We pulled up, got out of the car,
and approached the four boys. I heard the father asking
one of the patrol officers &quot;What are
you bothering my son for? He's worked on getting done with his parole, he doesn't do drugs
no more, he's going to school and doing well. Leave him
alone. He's not one of the gang members.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then one of the gang unit officers yelled at the father  &quot;Then why's he running with
<i> these</i> guys
(pointing to the other three youths)!?&quot; An extended and loud
argument ensued between the gang unit officer and the father. Both
were becoming angrier and more indignant by the second. &quot;Where are you when we need
you?&quot;, the father yelled. &quot;We have
kids sellin' drugs on the corner every night and here you are botherin' my
son! You can't be a nigger here!&quot; At this point another gang unit officer
announced &quot;We won't
go there. That line of talk is something we will not do.&quot;</p>
<p>The patrol officer (not a member of the gang unit) who initiated pulling the 
car over in the first place, walked slowly from where the boys were into the 
shouting match and handed the father his business card quietly informing him &quot;This is my personal phone number.
When
you see something we should know about, call me. Call me as soon as you can and
as often as you need. OK?&quot; The father stopped yelling, stared at the patrol
officer and extended his hand for
a handshake. Calmly, he thanked the patrol officer and stepped back. Calm had been restored.</p>
<p>No sooner did that happen than the gang unit
officer began yelling at the father again. &quot;You're not
taking proper care of your son!&quot; And the screaming started all over again.
It
seems to me some police create unpleasant situations themselves. I wondered if anyone was going to do something about the gang unit officer who
was so aggressive and offensive. Later in the evening, without my saying
a word, one of the gang unit officers I was riding with said &quot;He must just be in a bad
mood tonight,&quot; referring to the gang unit officer in question.</p>

<p>In 1999 a member of the Ramparts Division gang unit, Los Angeles Police
Department, was caught stealing several pounds of cocaine from the department's
property room. It had a reported street value of one million dollars. Caught by other police, he
confessed and, in a plea bargain negotiated with the prosecutor, provided testimony
against other officers in the gang unit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He told investigators about the activities
of other gang unit members including the killing of innocent people,
falsification of testimony in court, assaulting gang members, lying to
officers and others outside the gang unit, and observance of a code of silence to
stifle investigations into their colleagues' illegal behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b><font size="2">CRASH is the acronym for the Community Resources Against
  Street Hoodlums, an anti-gang program the (Los Angeles Police Department)
  implemented over a decade ago. The Rampart Division covers an eight
  square-mile area, just west of downtown, which is largely working class,
  heavily immigrant and densely populated.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">LAPD officer Rafael Perez joined Rampart CRASH in 1996.
  In 1998 Perez was arrested for stealing eight pounds of cocaine, valued at a
  million dollars, from the Rampart evidence locker. In 1999 Perez began to
  cooperate in giving evidence against his former associates in the hope of
  receiving a reduced sentence on the cocaine theft charge. On February 24, 2000
  Perez received a five-year prison term on the cocaine theft charges, but he is
  expected to stay in jail only a little over a year more, given time served and
  credit for good behavior.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">Last month the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>published many of
  the revelations from 2000 pages of Perez's testimony. The law-breaking
  activity among police was so pervasive that the <i>Times</i> concluded: An
  organized criminal subculture thrived within the LAPD, where a secret
  fraternity of anti-gang officers and supervisors committed crimes and
  celebrated shootings.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">Among the most chilling revelations concern outright
  police murders or attempted murders. In 1996 CRASH officer Kulin Patel shot
  Juan Saldana when he was running down an apartment hallway. Patel and his
  partner then planted a gun on Saldana after he went down. When the CRASH
  supervisor, Sergeant Edward Ortiz, arrived, he delayed calling an ambulance so
  the officers could concoct a cover story. Saldana bled to death by the time he
  arrived at the hospital.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">In another incident CRASH officers fired 10 rounds at
  Carlos Vertiz, a 44-year-old man with no criminal record, after they mistook
  him for a drug dealer. To justify the shooting, officers then planted a
  shotgun near the dying Vertiz which they claimed he had pointed at them.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">In 1996 Perez and his partner Nino Durden shot
  19-year-old Javier Ovando in the chest and head and then planted a gun on him.
  Ovando received a draconian 23-year prison sentence because he would not show
  contrition. In fact, he was innocent. Ovando was released last year, after
  serving two years. As a result of his injuries he is now confined to a
  wheelchair.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">On New Year's eve 1996, Rampart CRASH officers opened
  fire on and wounded two holiday revelers, afterwards arresting them on
  trumped-up charges. The officers then rehearsed the story that they had fired
  in self-defense, claiming the revelers had fired guns in the officers'
  direction. One unnamed officer has reportedly told his attorney that the CRASH
  cops were out hunting that night, that is, looking for people to ambush
  in sport.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">Perez told investigators the lengths to which Rampart
  officers and their supervisors went to cover up bad shootings. In one
  instance, a rookie patrol officer shot a man when he opened a closet during a
  search and was startled to see the man inside. When the rookie's supervisor
  arrived at the scene he decided the rookie should say the man was holding a
  mirror, causing him to see his own reflection with a gun and open fire,
  thinking he had encountered an armed suspect.</font></b><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KnowlandNebbia2000">Knowland

<p>Added to the Rodney King case, incidents like Ramparts place a community's
police in a perilous position. The public questions their
professionalism, distrusts them, and, without the support of the community,
police efforts to reduce gang activity (or any criminal activity, for that
matter) are handicapped.&nbsp;<p>In response to the Ramparts' gang unit's behavior, a
former Los Angeles gang member said &quot;Cops are just a gang with the law on their
side.&quot;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<p>In 1995, a new sheriff was elected to office in the Las Vegas area. Just a 
few years after he reorganized and focused his gang units efforts &quot;Las Vegas 
gang control efforts encountered a major stumbling block. Two gang unit officers 
committed a drive-by shooting ... One of (the gang unit's) officers opened the

</blockquote>
<p>The chorus of degradation represented by these incidents adds another element
to the gang situation and, like the gangs
themselves, needs to be corrected if we are to take steps to reduce gang activity. Having police act like gang members is not an acceptable,
ethnical, legal, or logical way to handle the gang situation.</p>
