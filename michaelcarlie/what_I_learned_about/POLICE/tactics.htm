<p>A police gang unit officer told me a

pagers for sending messages to one other. Using their pagers, three of the members who attended a
private school called in the rest of their gang. The three gang members wanted the rest of the gang to come to the school so they could assault two white boys there. When the other gang members arrived
they nearly killed both boys.</p>
<p>Local patrol officers investigated and called it a hate crime. They didn't
know a gang was involved. The hate crime investigator was called in and, investigating
the incident further, recognized it as a gang-motivated crime. I asked him &quot;Does it matter whether it was a gang
crime or not?&quot; I

<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Prevention">Prevention</a> and Intervention Tactics</font></b>
  </p>
<p>While most people I interviewed did not think of police as doing prevention
or intervention work related to gangs, they do. <b>Prevention</b> efforts are
used with individuals who have not yet become involved with a gang. <b>Intervention</b> efforts are used with marginally involved gang youth and with gang
members who want to leave a gang. Among the prevention and intervention
tactics or techniques I observed in use were:
  </p><b><font color="#0000FF">Education</font></b>
        <p>I observed police in public schools as they presented information to
        students, teachers, and administrators concerning gangs. One of the
        prevention programs I saw implemented by police was the Gang Resistance Education and
        Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program. We'll look more closely at it In the <i>Solutions</i>
        section of <i>Into the Abyss</i>.</p>
        <p>I also observed officers in meetings with concerned citizens and
        community-wide task force groups designed to deal with the gang
        situation in the local community. The police were typically used
        as sources of information concerning the gang situation and, as such,
        served an important role as educators of the community.</p>
        <p>To the extent that police are willing to participate in public
        information programs on television and radio, they can sometimes be
        found commenting on local, regional, national, and international gang
        issues.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Offering Direct Prevention and Intervention
        Services</font></b></p>
        <p>Because I observed a limited number of police agencies my exposure to
        direct gang prevention services by them was limited. In a few of
        the departments, however, it was apparent that individual officers (some
        of them in a gang unit, some not) cared about at-risk youth
        and attempted to dissuade them from getting involved in a neighborhood
        gang.</p>
        <p>Some of the officers played games with at-risk youth in local
        parks while others spent time at the local Boys and Girls Club playing
        basketball or got involved in some other sport. During my visits with
        them, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department offered a program called Vital Intervention and
        Directional Alternatives (VIDA).&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b><font size="2">VIDA is specifically designed to deal with
          &quot;at-risk&quot; youth and utilize pro-active, innovative
          techniques for positive redirection. Overseen by law enforcement
          personnel, the program offers treatment, prevention and punitive
          components to alter negative behavior. The most typical scenario
          would involve referrals from the Juvenile Courts or by parents who
          petition the court requesting that their children be admitted to the
          program.<br>
          <br>
          It is essential that law enforcement play a major role in the
          intervention and overall development of the participants. We are
          the first to make contact with &quot;at-risk&quot; youths.</font></b><font size="1">
          (VIDA, 
			<a href="http://www.lasd.org/releases/SHB-11A-02VIDADiplomasAwarded.htm">page</a> 
			- not the best page, but one of the few still on the web concerning 
			the VIDA program.)&nbsp;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Mediation</font></b></p>
        <p>In most contacts with suspects, police do not make an arrest. The situation is no different with
        real or suspected gang members. More
        often than not, if there is a conflict developing between gang members,
        police will attempt to mediate the situation rather than
        wait for it to erupt and be forced into making an arrest. I witnessed this on
        several occasions over the past three years.</p>
        <p>Mediation involves getting the aggrieved parties to sit
        down and communicate with one another through the mediator. There
        may or may not be a police officer trained in mediation, but attempts at
        mediation are still made. In two of the departments I observed the
        mediator was not a law enforcement officer but an adjunct professional
        mediator.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Divert and Refer</font></b></p>
        <p>The police I observed knew that if gang suspects were arrested and
        convicted, some of them would be incarcerated. Many officers believed some gang
        suspects needed attention, but confinement was not what they
        needed. They viewed confinement as aggravating the situation - producing a more hardened gang member.</p>
        <p>When this was the case, officers attempted to <i>divert</i> 
        suspects from the justice system (juvenile or adult/criminal) and <i>referred</i>
        them to a community-based agency
        or other source of assistance. This was accomplished by
        working with the suspects' family members or guardians or directly with
        the youths in question. If a member of the faith community or some
        other concerned citizen made known their interest in helping these
        youth, the youth was referred to them.</p>

                A seasoned gang unit supervisor told me &quot;We realize the
                need to divert individuals from becoming involved in the formal
                criminal justice process if there is a tactic, or action that
                will cause them to change their lives before they become just
                another statistic in the system.&nbsp;</font></b>
                <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;Unfortunately we
                practitioners consider this a success. The system is
                overburdened and the 'wheels of Justice turn slow.' These
                individuals are arrested and back on the streets before we can
                get back to the field. They are back on the streets ready to
                continue their criminal enterprise. If these individuals go back
                to school, work, or move (change their environment), local law enforcement
                feels this is a success.</font></b></p>
                <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;The cost of putting these
                individuals into the system is hard to measure considering the
                cost of incarceration, probation or parole supervision,
                continued substance abuse, domestic violence, single-parent
                homes, and fatherless children living in poverty. However,
                telling these thrill-seeking, reckless, impulsive personalities
                not to become involved in criminal activity rarely dissuades
                them from engaging in these types of activities.</font></b></p>
                <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;Dealing with individuals
                with this predisposition normally requires a significant or
                traumatic event to alter their life's course. I mean a loss of
                employment, loss of significant other, or loss of freedom - not
                by their choice. This tactic will work only for a short period
                of time during an individual's life - maybe the early teens to
                early twenties.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
                <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;This was the reason we [the
                gang unit] stayed on these youths to hopefully intervene before
                they got injured, pregnant, or drug addicted. We would call
                parents out of their beds to meet us at two or three in the
                morning to get their child. Hopefully this would stop a small
                number of potential problem makers. This also created contacts
                with parents and potential sources of intelligence.&quot;</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

        <p>Calling a youth's parents at two or three in the morning to get them
        to come pick up their errant youth is a form of diversion and referral used
        by some police gang unit officers. In addition, police sometimes

        unit officers participate is developing and cultivating these sources.&nbsp;
  </p>
        <p align="left">Among the primary sources of intelligence are concerned
        citizens, parents and guardians of gang members, gang members and their
        associates, girls friends and wives of gang members, delivery people
        (i.e., food, postal, delivery services), social agency personnel who work with

        because, in the past, problems have erupted in those locations at similar times. In
        like fashion, gang unit officers typically drive by suspected gang

hangouts, and drug houses, to familiarize themselves with those
        properties and their surroundings.</p>
        <p align="left">The police I observed were constantly learning their way
through the beat neighborhoods - both by car and on foot. Routes of escape had
to be learned as well as where suspects lived, the kinds of cars they drove,
        where they usually parked, and so on. Familiarization drives provided a foundation
upon which other tactics were based.</p>

normal shift a patrol car may drive through a given intersection
every hour or so. Where high visibility surveillance is being conducted that car
may drive through the intersection every 20 minutes, and it will be a marked
patrol car. Police on bikes, foot, or riding horseback may be used. Increasing the visibility of the police is intended to deter potential offenders
from offending - including gang members.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><b><font size="2">This tactic is more significant than it first
          appears. I will discuss the premise this is founded upon. Citizens
          with information or concerned about gangs were directed to me. I often
          arrived at work and found thirty to forty voice mails on my telephone.
          I listened to their messages then contacted those with the most
          promising information.</font></b></p>
          <p align="left"><b><font size="2">All the messages with potential gang information
          were forwarded to our department's Crime Analyst. She sorted through
          and summarized their content then provided a report with the most
          significant information underlined.</font></b></p>
          <p align="left"><b><font size="2">I distributed the reports to the rest of the gang
          unit. The officers then starting driving by the locations from which
          the calls originally came and wrote descriptions of vehicles in the
          vicinity, their license numbers, etc. I contacted the citizens
          discretely and provided them with the cellular phone and pager numbers
          for my unit's officers. That way the citizens would not get the normal
          run around by calling 911.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
          <p align="left"><b><font size="2">The citizens became our eyes and ears. We had so
          few officers that this was a necessity if we were going to be
          effective. When citizens called and got immediate service they were
          happy. Since we started showing up at just the right time (when
          trouble was brewing), the gang members thought some of their cronies
          were snitching on them. This sometimes caused distrust and dissention
          - they never really knew who they could trust.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
          <p align="left"><b><font size="2">The citizens loved us, however the problem
          children did not like the fact that we would show up any time any
          place. We did not drive up in front of their homes, lights flashing,
          radios turned up, slamming our car doors. Instead, we came out of
          nowhere.</font></b></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>When we were alerted that something was going on,
          we moved into the area wearing our POLICE vests, jackets, and
          insignia. We stopped cars using our red lights, and talked to
          interested people in the area. They were possible future information
          sources.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>The troublemakers thought &quot;Holly cow the
          cops are all over us - they know what we are doing!&quot; Hopefully
          they would move to another area then it would take a few months for
          the new neighbors to identify the trouble makers and the process would

        <p align="left">Law enforcement agencies across the nation are building
databases of gang-related information. Not all jurisdiction have
them or even want them. Some of those who have them don't use them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>A new national gang database was designed, and became
operational on October 1, 1995. The Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File
(VGTOF) is a component of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and is
tailored after the NCIC Wanted Persons File records. The system is operated and
managed by the FBI with input from an advisory board.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>The database provides identifying information about gangs
and gang members to law enforcement personnel. This information serves to warn
law enforcement personnel of the potential danger posed by violent individuals,
and promotes the exchange of information about gangs and their members to
facilitate criminal investigations. This pointer system acts as an early warning
system in apprising local law enforcement agencies of an emerging gang problem.</b></font><font size="1">

</blockquote>
        <p align="left">Databases are costly to develop and maintain and their content is constantly changing
as gang members move, die, get locked up, buy new cars, divorce, remarry, change
        names, and so
on. When used, they can be an effective way of locating suspected
gangsters for whom warrants have been issued and for providing law
enforcement agencies with information about migrating gang members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Confidential Informants</font></b></p>
        <p align="left">Found in nearly
every aspect of policing, confidential informants (CIs) are an important element
        in the array of
tactics employed by police gang units as well as police in all other units.
        Older gang members who are tired of the gang
scene and want to see it come to an end sometimes turn into CIs. They are particularly useful
when it comes to impending acts of violence - which they would prefer to see
        avoided. There are also young gang members who get caught breaking the law whose
behavior goes unreported by gang unit officers in exchange for needed information.</p>
        <p align="left">The tactics we've discussed so far, and those to follow, are sometimes
        used in concert with other tactics. In addition, other law enforcement agencies may be
        engaged to employ them.</p>

          - believed to be responsible for 15 murders - that trafficked in drugs

        <p align="left">Nearly all specialized groups in a society develop a language of
        their own - certain phrases, sayings, or terms that are peculiar to each
        group. A specialized language is also referred to as <i>argot</i>. Lawyers have their
        argot (i.e.,
        &quot;party of the third part&quot;), students have an argot (i.e.,

          of individual gang members, are common in gang graffiti. Code
          words are often nothing more than street slang but may also include

        <p align="left">The tactic, then, becomes learning the argot of gangs. This is not an

        differ from one gang to another and from one community to another. It's
        worth learning, however, because knowing what's being communicated provides officers with
        intelligence on who's in the neighborhood, who's angry at
        who, where drug deals are occurring, what's being planned, and more.</p>

        <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Involvement with Other Community Agencies</font></b></p>
        <p align="left">By
maintaining contact with community members in non-police agencies, gang unit
        officers continue to gather intelligence and have an
opportunity to share what they know. The contacts may be informal or formalized,
        as they are in a community-wide task force on gangs.</p>
        <p align="left">I observed gang unit officers who were involved with school personnel,&nbsp; juvenile/probation/parole
        officers, members of local faith institutions and business organizations, and a multitude of community-based
        service agencies ranging from family violence and child abuse centers to Boys
and Girls Club. People in each of these agencies have something of value to
        offer gang unit officers. The reverse is also
true. Representatives from the schools, faith institutions, and the business
community benefit from hearing about their local gang situation and may, in return, be able to do something to help reduce
        gang activity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Community-based agencies may also be able to help
prevent children from becoming involved in gangs if they know what's going on -
and the gang unit members can help them learn about that. These are
the kinds of things that happen when a community task force on gangs and youth violence is created and
        is working effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as suppression, these enforcement activities include
detaining (holding without arrest) or arresting suspects. Among the
tactics used are:
  </p><p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Consent to Search</font></b>
  </p>
        <p> I accompanied gang unit officers as they approached suspected gang
        members' residences and asked for permission to enter and look around. It
didn't matter whether the person answering the door was a parent, guardian of
the gang member, or a gang member him- or herself ... most
allowed the officer to enter and search.
  </p>
        <p>One of the benefits of the consent to search tactic is that
        police are liberated from legal constraints that would normally be imposed
        if there were no consent. If consent was required, they would have to show probable
        cause - and that can sometimes be difficult.

        <blockquote>
          <p><b><font size="2"><a name="Fagan"></a>The consent to search has become a very effective
          and important part of legal search and seizures. This investigative

          to patrol officers.&nbsp;</font></b>

        <p>Consent to search visits produce intelligence
about gang members' activities and associates (often found in photographs) and
        sometimes result in arrests when contraband (i.e., stolen goods, illegal drugs, paraphernalia)
        is found. This tactic is also used with suspects'
vehicles.
  </p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Humiliation</font></b></p>
        <p>It was about two o'clock in the
morning and I was riding through a large mid-west city's inner-city area in an
unmarked police gang unit car. There were two gang unit members in the
front seat, I was sitting in the back seat alone. The officers
        stopped the car and stared at a group of three African-American males who were
leaning against a car while smoking some marijuana.</p>
<p>As we approached, the one with the marijuana threw it under the car. The officers got out, told the suspects to &quot;Just stand
there,&quot; and looked for and found the marijuana. The suspect who
had thrown it down was handcuffed and placed in the back seat with
me.&nbsp;For the next 15 minutes we drove around the neighborhood as the police and I
questioned this 23 year old suspect. He was not affiliated with a gang, had a
job, and was supporting the mother of his child while living with his
grandparents.</p>
        <p>The officers gathered all the intelligence they were going to get and
decided not to arrest him. Instead, they said &quot;That's it. We'll
drop you off.&quot; &quot;Please don't drop me off in front of my
grandparent's home,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&quot;I don't want them to know you picked me
        up.&quot; &quot;OK,&quot; said the officer, and he proceeded to not
only drop the man off in front of his grandparents' home, he honked before he did
it.</p>
        <p>This subtle form of intimidation was intended to humiliate and
        embarrass the man and to establish that the cops were what? Tough? Not
        to be reckoned with? I was somewhat mystified and received no
        intelligible answer when I asked why they did what they did. In fact, it struck
        me that they alienated someone who could have been of some use to them
        at a later date.</p>

        <p>Regardless, in one community after another, police harassed, embarrassed,
        and humiliated gang members without seeming to give what they were doing
        a second thought. In time, as I was told, it was being done to
        &quot;prove we (the officers) are in control&quot; and &quot;to get
        their (gang members') respect.&quot; I think it also creates a great
        deal of anger towards police.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Cuffing</font></b></p>
        <p>Regardless of whether the
suspected gang member we pulled over or stopped had allegedly committed a
violation of the law or not, some gang unit officers cuffed them before
doing anything else. As one of them told me, &quot;You
have to get their respect. If you don't, the next officer they confront
will pay for it.&quot;</p>
        <p>Once again, as it appeared to me, the tactic alienated and angered 
        suspects as they were rendered helpless without probable cause. It 
        seemed an abuse of power, although some police insisted it made their 
        interaction with gang members safer. That's probably true, in the short 
        run.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Zero Tolerance</font></b></p>
        <p>This tactic involves
stopping vehicles and running the occupants' drivers license numbers through the
National Crime Information Center (NCIC) in Washington, D.C., or through some
other central database containing information on criminal offenders.&nbsp;The pretext for stopping the
        vehicle may be a broken tail light or some
        other minor infraction. Having been found in violation of some ordinance
        or law, police now have <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Probable Cause">probable
        cause</a> to hold, question, and search the suspect and certain parts of
        his or her vehicle.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the zero tolerance tactic is to obtain information and
        make the point that the police are in the area and actively pursuing
        &quot;the bad guys.&quot; In addition, police will attempt to collect whatever other useful
information they can by questioning the suspects.&nbsp;It's like &quot;panning

In addition to determining if any of the occupants have warrants out for their
arrest, gang unit officers learn whether the car the suspect is driving is
the car associated with the drivers license, and who's riding around or associating
with who. A visual search of the car may take place and, if
the officer feels like it, he may ask for the driver's consent to search the entire
car.</p>
<p>One of the Caucasian gang members I interviewed, a man who has since turned his
life around and is living a legitimate existence, told me &quot;A police policy

        <p>Some gang unit officers attempt to instill paranoia in gang members'
        minds in
        hopes of turning gang members against one another. A gang
        supervisor told me &quot;Sometimes I get information about gang activity
        from local residents. I may use that information and, if it leads
        to arresting a gang member, he'll say 'How'd you know about that? Who's been talkin' to you?' Then I tell him 'I have
        snitches. You know
        that. Do you really know your friends?' Then he starts
        getting paranoid and starts wondering which one of his own are talking
        to the police. It works. We keep them off balance like
        that.&quot; That's a form of psychological warfare.</p>

        <p>Although one might take inner-department
cooperation for granted, I learned many years ago that would be a
mistake. Inner-departmental jealousies and misunderstandings are rampant
in American law enforcement as they are in many other bureaucracies. With limited resources and badly
deteriorating communication, cooperation between gang units and the rest of
        their departments was an exception rather than the rule in the departments I
visited.</p>
        <p>Where cooperation existed I found patrol officers asking questions of their
suspects which they could only have learned to ask if the patrol officers had
        spoken with the gang unit officers. Gang-related cases that fell into 
        the hands of the patrol- or narcotics units usually
        found their way to
the gang unit in departments where cooperation between the units was found. Where there
was a lack of cooperation, the patrol- or narcotics unit handled the case 
        without informing the gang unit. Little, if any,
information was exchanged.</p>

to track down illegally possessed guns, and things like that. And, when a

is treatment. That is, once an offender (a gang member for our purposes) is

returned to society without treatment? Later in <i>Into the Abyss</i> you'll
