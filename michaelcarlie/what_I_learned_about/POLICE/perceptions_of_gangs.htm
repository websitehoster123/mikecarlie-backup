    have been put in jeopardy. For the most part, however, what they had to say
    they would have shared with anyone concerned enough to sit quietly and
    listen.</p>
		<p align="left">I've chosen a few of their comments from my field notes and tried to put them
    into  meaningful categories, which is what you will find below. The
    comments are representative of the nearly 400 pages of single-spaced, typed 
    field notes I collected from interviewing police.</p>

    be absent from the streets of their community. They viewed gangs
    as a necessary evil - something that's been around for a long time and will
    remain. Most guessed the gang situation would get worse in the future due to increasing diversity in
    the inner-city
    populations, the ever-widening divide between the rich and the poor,
    globalization and a concomitant loss of jobs or lowering of pay scales, society's increasing reliance on
    technology (resulting in fewer jobs for the poor, uneducated, and unskilled), and inner-city
    youths' continuing failure in school. It was a bleak picture, but it is
    supported by the findings of many social researchers who have reached the same conclusion.</p>
		<p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b><a name="Stereotypes">Stereotypes</a>, Police, and Gang Members</b></font></p>
		<p align="left">The term &quot;stereotype&quot; was used 
		<a href="#stereotyped">earlier</a>
    in describing how some police
    viewed inner-city residents. Stereotypes are important to understand,
    particularly as concerns their impact upon those who harbor them and those upon 
    whom
    they are imposed.</p>
		<p align="left">Stereotypes are defined as &quot;unreliable generalizations about all
    members of a group that do not recognize individual differences within the
    group.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Schaefer2001">Schaefer</a>,
    2001, p. 259)</font> I believe everyone uses stereotypes, at least until
    they get to know the people they are stereotyping and find the stereotype is
    useless. Police stereotype inner-city residents and inner-city
    residents stereotype the police. Both stereotypes are inaccurate and often
    lead to conflicts and misunderstanding.</p>
		<p align="left">I believe police stereotype gang members and gang members stereotype the
    police. I certainly heard enough stereotypical comments from each about the
    other to believe there are many misunderstanding between the two groups.
    There's another problem which arises from the use of stereotypes and it has
    a direct bearing upon the gang situation and police. Schaefer tells us &quot;In certain situations, we may respond to
    stereotypes in such a way that false&quot; stereotypes &quot; end up being
    accurate. In this phenomenon, called the<i> self-fulfilling prophecy</i>, a
    person or group that is described as having particular characteristics
    begins to display those very traits.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Schaefer2001">Schaefer</a>,
    2001, p. 259)</font></p>
		<p align="left">If I stereotype gang members as aggressive, I will respond to a gang
    member as though he were aggressive. My response may elicit aggressiveness
    in the gang member. As Schaefer said, my response made the gang member
    behave aggressively and I can then say &quot;See, I told you gang members
    were aggressive!&quot; It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
		<p align="left">In this same fashion, I believe some police stereotype gang members as
    hostile or aggressive and, without provocation, respond to them as though
    they are going to be hostile and aggressive. The response they get in turn
    is just what they had anticipated, even though it didn't have to be that
    way. I witnessed this many times over the past three years. There were situations in which officers started their interaction with
    suspected gang members in a hostile manner. The situation quickly
    escalated as both the police officer and the suspected or real gang member became hostile
    and aggressive towards one another.</p>

            military. She said &quot;I like the way it sort of keeps them (gang
            members) off balance. They don't know what to do with a cop with a
            knife. They know about the gun. That's one thing. But the knife ...
            it's something else to them. It confuses them. I like that.&quot;&nbsp;</font></b>

all parties involved and simply made matters worse.</p>
		<p align="left">Two years after conducting my original field work, Katz and 
	Webb conducted a study which, in part, looked at how police gang unit 
	members viewed their role. They found that</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Gang unit officers appeared united in 
		the perception of themselves as crime fighters, regardless of their 
		units' formal mandates. Our observations suggested that the gang unit 
		officers perceived their units not as responding to <i>crime</i>, so 
		much as responding to <i>groups of individuals</i> whom they believed to 
		be deeply involved in criminal activities. Although this may bee a fine 
		distinction, it is meaningful. Gangs and gang members, not just their 
		criminal acts, were viewed by the officers as the threat, and gang unit 
		officers believed that their mission was to protect the community by 
		combating those gangs. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz
