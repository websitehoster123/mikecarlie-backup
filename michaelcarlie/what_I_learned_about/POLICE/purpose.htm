    <p>What I found most confusing was observing gang units which had
    responsibilities for other kinds of offenses or offenders. A case in point was
    one gang unit which was responsible for vice crimes (i.e., gambling,
    prostitution, and other sex offenses), organized crime, and gangs. The
    offenders/offenses upon which the unit focused depended upon the whims of
    the chief.&nbsp; His choices depended upon directions given him by the City
    Manager who, in turn, was being responsive to public pressure.</p>
    <p>My own feeling was that multi-tasking a gang unit weakened efforts in all of
    its endeavors. They worked gangs, started building needed intelligence, then
    were taken away from that work and placed on vice crimes. Once the
    vice offenders had been dealt with the officers returned to work gangs but
    the intelligence was no longer current.</p>
    <p>In most of the departments I visited the gang unit was just that - all
    they dealt with was gangs. My task was to determine what the goals of the
    gang units were and how they attempted to reach them. In one community I
    asked a gang unit member what his primary concern was. He replied &quot;I
    am concerned for the safety and quality of life of people in this community.
    Making arrests is secondary to developing a high quality of life for
    them.&quot;</p>
    <p>In another community I asked a seasoned gang unit officer the same
    question. He said &quot;The goals of this gang unit are suppression
    and wiping these guys out. There's no changing the ones who are committed to
    the life. They don't know anything else and they won't listen to anything
    else.&quot;</p>
    <p>I learned that the primary goal of any police gang unit is to produce a
    reduction in gang activity. While it make take the entire community to
    produce this result, the police are expected to make their contribution
    towards that goal. At the procedural level, the goal of all gang units is to carry out their
    activities with respect for the due process rights of everyone they
    encounter. Without due process, few cases will be won in court unless, of
    course, one relies upon plea bargaining as a consequence of a poorly managed
    case.</p>
	<p>In their research, Katz and Webb found &quot;wide variations in the existence 
	and adequacy of written polices and procedures governing the gang units that 
	we studied.&quot; One gang unit had no written guidelines and no formal 
	documentation of the unit's functions. <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 184) </font>&nbsp;On the other 
	hand, the researchers found a gang unit with a continually updated, 
	fifty-page document outlining, in some detail, the standard operating 
	procedures of that unit. Without clearly articulated and agreed-to policies 
	and procedures, the gang unit takes on the culture of the department or, at 
	the least, the culture of the gang unit passed along from one member to 
	another.</p>
	<p>In their report, <i>Police Response to Gang: A Multi-Site Study</i>, Katz 
	and Webb found that</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>In addition to providing gang unit officers with 
		guidance as to their functions and the activities that they were to 
		perform, the Las Vegas unit's policy manual described general issues 
		pertaining to the coordination of training, the operation of the 
		section's library, the management of criminal intelligence information, 
		and records retention. It also provided information pertaining to 
		officer uniforms, property assigned to officers, personal appearance, 
		and the issuance of departmental vehicles. The manual dedicated 
		considerable space to specific procedures for disseminating gang 
		intelligence, handling confidential informants, maintaining 
		investigative files, making media releases, establishing seizure logs, 
		and obtaining search warrants. </b></font> <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz

	</blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The <a name="Duties"> Duties</a> of a Police Gang Unit</font></b></p>
    <p>Where they exist, gang units vary in complexity from simple one-person 
	operations having one function (typically gathering intelligence for all the 
	department's other units) to multi-group, multi-layered organizations 
	collecting intelligence, carrying out investigations, participating in 
	multi-agency task forces and with sub-groups each dedicated to the pursuit 
	of one type or kind of gang or another.</p>
	<p>Generalizing from my observations and those from Katz's and Webb's 
	experience in Las Vegas, Phoenix, Albuquerque, and Inglewood (CA) <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 172), </font>the primary duties of 
	a police gang unit include <b> gathering intelligence</b>,
    carrying out <b>investigations</b>, applying <b>suppression/enforcement</b>, 
	offering <b>education</b> (for prevention and intervention purposes), and <b>involvement in a gang task force</b>.</p>
	<p>The intelligence
    function, which, as Klein found, was the primary function of 83% of gang 
	units across the United States <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Klein1995b">Klein</a>, 
	1995)</font>, was discussed <a href="stages.htm#Study">previously</a>. Carrying
    out investigations is part and parcel of building intelligence and is often
    used to justify requests for search warrants and seizure/arrest warrants.
    </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="center"><b><font size="2" color="#008000">[In their research 
		on the Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Inglewood (CA), and Phoenix Police 
		Departments' gang units, Katz and Webb found that] &quot;... some of the gang 
		units that we studied were devoting relatively little time to criminal 
		investigation activities. The gang units' involvement in criminal 
		investigation tended to be indirect, performed largely as part of the 
		intelligence function.&quot; </font><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="1">(</font></b><font size="1"><a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 176)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Another aspect of the intelligence function is that it provides other 
	members of the police department with needed information. Katz and Webb 
	relate a comment made to them during their research by an Inglewood (CA) 
	gang unit officer. Asked why other, non-gang-unit officers turned to him for 
	information, he replied</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><b><font size="2">Probably the knowledge of knowing almost everybody 
		on the street, because our job is to contact and talk and become 
		personally involved in these gangsters' lives, their family lives, their 
		mothers, their school lives, so we get to know the people. We don't know them 
		all, I mean, there is just too many of them to know, but we know most of 
		them, the ones that are the most active, and we know a lot about them, 
		and they talk to us, and we know a lot of what is going on in the 
		street. And so we are kind of like an encyclopedia here of what is going 
		on in the city, and everybody come to us because of it ... </font>
		<font size="1">(</font></b><font size="1"><a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 303)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Suppression refers to deterring gang members from committing crimes by
    arresting them. Deterrence is further offered by educating the citizenry 
	about gangs in hopes of preventing gang activity and gang joining, and 
	intervening in the lives of those who are on the fringes of gang activity 
	and membership. That educational process may take place through a 
	community-wide task force on gangs and/or youth violence. A variety of methods are available for each of these primary
    duties. Unfortunately, like Katz and Webb <font size="1">
	(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 176)</font>, I found most of the 
	gang units observed had little, if anything, to do with gang-related 
	prevention efforts in their respective communities (save for some units 
	being involved in the G.R.E.A.T. program).</p>
	<p>A policy of suppression may also have consequences on the quantity and 
	quality of intelligence a gang unit may collect. Katz and Webb report that, 
	when asked why other police agencies contacted the Inglewood (CA) police 
	gang unit for intelligence instead of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
	gang unit, one Inglewood officer said</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>LAPD CRASH (Los Angles Police Department's gang 
		unit) can not get fuck for intelligence. All they do is enforcement. 
		They bust heads, so nobody will talk to them ... </b></font> <font size="1">
		(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 304)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
    <p>The inner-workings of a gang unit are designed around the primary
    duties. In some units there are one or more officers assigned to each -
    intelligence officers, investigators, and those who make arrests. The intelligence
    officers and investigators may each be assigned a different kind of gang to
    observe (i.e., Asian gangs, Hispanic gangs, African-American gangs, Bikers,
    Gangster Disciples, Bloods, Skinheads).
    In other units officers may share all of these responsibilities.</p>
    <p>In addition to intelligence, investigation, and suppression, other
    functions or duties of a police gang unit may include:</p>

    <p>Of the four police department gang units they studied, Katz and Webb 
	state that the Las Vegas unit was the only one with clearly articulated 
	goals and objectives. <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 198)</font>&nbsp; Without goals and 
	objectives, what do officers or supervisors do when they join and work in 
	such a unit and how do the department, the media, or the community assess 
	their performance? Katz and Webb report the goals and objectives of the Las 
	Vegas (NV) Police Department's gang unit as follows.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>The Gang Investigation Section (GIS) of the 
		Organized Crime Bureau (OCB) of the Special Operations Division (SOD) 
		will be responsible for the lawful collection, analyzation (sic), 
		dissemination of intelligence information, and the follow-up 
		investigation of gang-motivated crime, except crimes involving homicide, 
		sexual assault, or high profile takeover robberies, such as casino 
		robberies.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>The objectives of the Gang Investigation Section 
		are to suppress street gang criminal activity through lawful arrests and 
		prosecution, and to deter street gang criminal activity through the 
		lawful collection, analyzation (sic), and dissemination of intelligence 
		information. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz

	</blockquote>
	<p align="left">In addition to identifying suppression, investigation, and 
	education/prevention as describing how gang unit officers allocate their 
	time, Katz and Webb also noted some gang unit officers also allocated time 
	to administrative duties, en route activity, and non-police related 
	functions as follows.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>(Administrative activities included) 
		Field preparation, report production, evidence processing, meeting with

	</blockquote>
	<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Methods">Methods</a> of Policing Gangs</font></b></p>
    <p>Police have a variety of methods and tactics at their disposal for reducing gang
    activity in a community. In addition to gathering and analyzing
    intelligence and making arrests (suppression), other methods used include <b>deterrence</b>,
    <b>education</b>, <b>mediation, </b>and <b>diversion and referral</b>. Each
    of these are explored below while tactics are addressed later in the book.<br>
    <br>
 <b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Deterrence">Deterrence</a></font></b> </p>
    <p>Deterrence is achieved by police gang units in a variety of ways. The
    goal of deterrence is to keep gang activity from occurring or to reduce the
	<i>amount</i> of gang activity taking place. &quot;The underlying 
	assumption of the suppression strategy is based on deterrence theory: that 
	swift, severe, and certain punishment will lead to the reduction of 
	gang-related activity among current gang members <i>(also referred to as 
	specific deterrence</i>)<i>,</i> as well as to a deduction in the number of 
	individuals who want to participate in gangs and gang behavior in the future
	<i>(referred to as general deterrence</i>)<i>.&quot;</i> <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 15, italics added by Carlie.)</font></p>
	<p>The most typical
    method used is maintaining a <i>physical presence</i>  in the neighborhood.
    Among the techniques used to do this are:</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p><b><font color="#008000">a. Focused routine preventive patrol:</font> </b>Focused
  routine preventive patrol finds police driving marked or unmarked police cars
  through gang territory using a <b>random</b>  pattern. While unmarked cars are
  recognized as easily as marked cars, it is hoped that the continued but
  irregular appearance of either will deter gang activity.<br>
    <br>
  <font color="#008000">
    <b>b. Directed patrol:</b>  </font> Directed patrol results from the police
  driving marked and unmarked cars through gang territory in a <b>pre-determined</b> 
  manner. One example of this technique is when three police cars drive in
  tandem down each of three adjacent and parallel streets. The objective of this
  technique is to find individuals who may be avoiding the police by &quot;squeezing&quot; them down the streets to a predetermined
  place where another police car awaits.&nbsp; Much like squeezing a tube of
  toothpaste, regardless of where the toothpaste is in the tube, upon squeezing
  it the toothpaste comes one at only one place. That's where a police car
  awaits the fleeing gang member.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#008000">c. Non-vehicular patrol:</font></b>  For lack of a
  better name, non-vehicular patrol refers to the employment of anything other than a
  police car while using the techniques described above. In this regard, police
  may use bicycles, horses,
  motorcycles, helicopters, and traditional foot patrol to deter gang activity.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    The following is an account of a typical &quot;stop&quot; conducted by gang unit 
	officers. </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>When an individual who had been stopped did fit the 
		profile of gang membership, the officer would assess whether he or she 
		was actually involved in gangs. First, officers would order the suspect 
		out of the car and ask for a driver's license, vehicle registration, and 
		insurance documents. Meanwhile, the officers were scanning the suspect's 
		arms, hands, and ankles for gang tattoos, and examining their clothing, 
		belt buckle, shoes, and hair style for indications of involvement in the 
		gang lifestyle.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Officers also examined personal property such as 
		school books or bags for gang graffiti, and interviewed the suspect 
		about gang affiliation. The officer would ask the suspect questions: 
		Where are you going? Who are you down with? Who do you hang out with? 
		Were you ever down with a gang? All of this would take place while the 
		officer's partner was running the individual's name for possible 
		warrants.</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>If the officer determined that the individual was a 
		gang member or met the criteria for gang membership, he completed a FI 
		(field interview) card and took a Polaroid picture of the person. He 
		would also ask permission to search the vehicle. Even though typically 
		no reason was given for searches, all suspects whom we observed 
		permitted the officers to search their vehicles. If the individual had 
		no warrants for arrest and if there was no incriminating evidence, he or 
		she would be released. </b></font> <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 275)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
    The next most common method of deterring gang activity is to <b>arrest</b> 
	gang members. Sometimes the arrests are made to simply take someone (or 
	several people) off the street for a day or two and sometimes they are made 
	in hopes of getting a conviction and removing the suspect for a longer 
	period of time.</p>
	<p>
    <b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Education">Education</a></font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font color="#008000">In Schools:</font> </b></p>
      <p>Gang unit personnel,
      much like D.A.R.E. (Drug Awareness and Resistance Education) officers,
      attempt to deter gang membership and gang activity through a variety of
      education programs. These programs include making presentations to
      students, teachers, security personnel, and administrators in the local schools.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Audiences are informed about a number of things including the
      nature and danger of gangs, how to determine if a student is involved in
      gang activity, who to report gang activity to, how to secure the school
      against gang activity, and what role the school can play in helping its
      students and staff avoid gang involvement. The United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) has,
      in conjunction with the Phoenix (Arizona) Police Department, developed a
      course of instruction called the Gang Resistance Education and Training
      &nbsp;(G.R.E.A.T.) to accomplish this goal.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Through a series of nine one-hour in-class sessions, gang unit officers
      provide 3rd and 5th grade students an opportunity to develop a means of
      resisting gangs. The program is built upon the belief that youths who have
      a positive self-concept, accept and embrace diversity, and develop
      non-violent techniques for resolving conflict are less likely to be
      interested in joining a gang.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#008000">For the Business and Faith Communities:</font> </b></p>
      <p>Similar
      education efforts are offered members of the business community (through
      presentations to such organizations as the Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis,
      Lions, Rotary, and Junior League) and faith community. Health care
      providers, the media, and other social institutions may also be included.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#008000">For the General Public: </font> </b></p>
      <p>Appearances
      on local television and radio programs are another aspect of the public
      education function of a police gang unit. Joining discussion and debate panels, making
      individual appearances, and offering insights on the news of the day as it
      relates to gangs are some of the public education functions of the unit.</p>
      <p>Publications prepared by the gang unit may also be created and
      circulated throughout the community and web sites are sometimes created
      which can be used to further educate the user about gangs.</p>
  <p><b><font color="#008000">Community-Wide Task Force involvement:</font></b> </p>
  <p>In communities throughout the United States, police gang unit personnel
  participate in local task force groups in an effort to prevent and/or reduce
  gang activity and to educate the public. A typical task force consists
  of representatives from many of the community's social institutions including
  the faith institutions, schools, mental health agencies, juvenile and family
  services, representatives from neighborhood associations, business community,
  law enforcement, the prosecutor's office, and other concerned citizens.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Mediation">Mediation</a></font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> I observed gang unit officers
      mediating conflicts and potential conflicts between gang members both within
      the same gang and between rival gang members. Although in all instances
      the mediation was impromptu, it was mediation all the same.</p>
      <p>A conflict between two gang members was happening or about to happen
      and the officer entered the situation and attempted to get the parties to
      resolve the conflict without the use of violence. Ex-gang members have been known to be involved in such efforts in the
      past, but the involvement of police in mediation remains a relatively
      unexplored topic.&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"> <a name="Diversion and Referral"> Diversion and Referral</a></font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, diversion and referral is a process of <i>diverting </i>alleged
      offenders from the juvenile- or criminal justice system in order to <i>refer
      </i>them to a community agency, organization, or
      program so they can get help.</p>
      <p>This process is used by gang unit officers when they attempt
      to steer a youth involved in gang activity to a community agency for help.
      It is most often used with offenders who have committed minor crimes and those who are not
      yet committed to the gang life. Another form of referral and diversion
      occurs when gang unit officers provide parental notification.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#008000">Parental Notification: </font> </b></p>
      <p>Depending
      upon the community, police gang unit officers or truant officers may be
      used to notify parents of the school's belief that their child is involved in a gang or gang behavior.
      Typically received in the mail, the notification explains the basis for
      the school's belief and invites the parents and their child to meet with school
      representatives trained to discuss the matter. Through this technique it
      is hoped that early detection and family-oriented action, in conjunction
      with the school, will deter youths from further gang involvement.</p>
  <p><b><font color="#008000">Home Visits: </font> </b></p>
  <p>Gang unit officers, at
  the request of concerned parents or guardians, will sometimes visit a home in
  order to talk with a child who is believed (by the parents or guardians) to be
  involved with gang youth or in gang behavior. The methods used to achieve this end include the use of threats (&quot;If
  I'm called out here again to talk with you, you can bet I'll be watching for
  you on the street.&quot;), cautions (&quot;If you keep on acting like this
  you're going to end up with these guys and your future will be ruined.&quot;),
  and counseling (&quot;We have some people [<i>or a program, etc.</i>] who
  would be willing to help you - if you want someone to talk to or help you with
  school work. Would you like to me to have them call you?&quot;). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            attention then turned to the son as he asked him how he was
            doing. In the process he asked the young man to enter his
            bedroom and, while there, the supervisor looked over the room,
            opened dresser drawers, leafed through papers at the head of the

	<p align="left"><b>At the end of the day, no gang unit, no matter how well 
	trained, how large, or how effective, is going to rid a community of its 
	gangs</b>. Logic suggests that, if a gang unit were successful in its efforts, 
	the number of gang-related arrests would increase, more cases would be 
	submitted for prosecution, and the cases would have sufficient prosecutorial 
	merit to conclude with a conviction and long prison term (and enhanced 
	whenever possible). </p>
	<p align="left">Such a situation will result in more gang members being sent 
	to prison and, almost certainly, to a long-term increase in the number of 
	gang members and the number of gang-related/motivated crimes. Prison does 
	not cure criminality. On the contrary, time in prison makes it practically 
	impossible for any inmate to build a law-abiding life once released into the 
	community (few employers are interested in hiring them). And survival in 
	prison often requires joining a gang for self-protection.</p>
	<p align="left">Just think of the meaning of these statistics: about 90% of 
	all prisoners in the United States will eventually be release or discharged from prison. 
	Every year, nearly 500,000 inmates are being released/discharged back into 
	society. A percentage of those inmates are gang members. They 
	were gang members before they arrived in prison or became gang members in 
	prison. The flow of gang members into and out of America's prisons is well 
	documented and suggests that a suppression-only policy will fail to 
	effectively reduce the number of gang members, the number of gangs, or the 
	amount of crime committed by gang members.</p>
	<p align="left">A <b>suppression-only</b> policy is likely doomed. Only when 
	suppression is coupled with prevention (keeping youth from joining gangs) 
	and intervention (helping those loosely associated with a gang leave the 
	gang) will the dynamic work. And the police are <i>not</i> responsible for 
	all three approaches. The entire community must enter the fray. Every 
	individual is responsible as are the faith community, the business 
	community, and the local educational system.</p>
	<p align="left">Katz and Webb offer the following as reasons why evaluating 
	gang units is so important. </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Without performance measures, managers 
		are unable to make effective administrative decisions relating to 
		training, officer evaluations, and promotions. Performance measures 
		allow managers to provide feedback and guidance to unit personnel, so 
		they can continue to grow in productivity and effectiveness. Systematic 
		evaluation of the unit and its personnel provides information to 
		managers concerning the means that the unit uses to address gang-related 
		problems. It keeps management up-to-date on the support (i.e., personnel 
		and other resources) needed to address the gang problem.</b></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Performance evaluations provide a 
		means of formally socializing gang unit officers and holding them 
		accountable. The measures convey agency expectations and inform unit 
		officers, in an official and formal way, about the mission, goals, and 
		priorities of the unit. Performance measures are essentially a detailed 
		list of expectations regarding the types and numbers of activities that 
		are to be performed and their quality. Performance evaluations also 
		socialize officers informally, communicating acceptable styles of 
		policing, and they help to create a shared vision of what constitutes 
		successful gang control. Finally, performance measure facilitate 
		professional development among officers in the unit. </b></font>

	</blockquote>
	<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Who Should <a name="Serve">Serve</a> 
	in a Police Gang Unit?</font></b></p>
	<p align="left">What type of officers should be in a police department's 
	gang unit? If the primary goal is suppression (making arrests), that kind of 
	gang unit would require a different kind of officer than would be required 
	by a gang unit that is primarily intelligence and/or prevention-oriented. 
	Katz and Webb found that, in the four department's they studied, gang unit 
	officers had to have at least three (3) years of street experience as a cop. 
	In addition they could not have a complaint record and had to be 
	self-motivated. Previous experience with gangs or the gang unit was 
	preferred as was the ability to speak one or more of the languages spoken by 
	members of the local gangs and to be a member of one of the minority 
	ethnic/racial groups found in the community. <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 222-226)</font></p>
	<p align="left">In three of the four department's they studied, Katz and 
	Webb note that &quot;... they sought officers who would not require a great deal 
	of oversight and who would be aggressive in the field.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 223) </font>&quot;Perhaps the most 
	interesting finding, however, turned out to be a qualification that was 
	missing from the lists of gang unit managers&quot; in three of the four cities 
	they studied. &quot;We were surprised to find that new gang unit officers were <i>
	not</i> required to have even minimal prior investigative experience, given 
	the seriousness of the crimes that they would be required to investigate. <font size="1">
	(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 227 italics added for emphasis.)</font></p>
	<p align="left">Police work is, to a very large extent, a solitary pursuit. 
	Officers on foot patrol walk alone. Patrol officers drive around town alone 
	in their cars hour after hour, day after day, year after year. When they 
	happen upon a crime scene, they are typically alone, as they are when they 
	prepare their reports. On the other hand, working in a police gang unit 
	typically requires a mind-set that is compatible with working as a team 
	member. As Katz and Webb found,</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left"><b><font size="2">For some officers, the primary 
		problems encountered after transferring to the gang unit were associated 
		with the new working environment. As a group, these officers tended to 
		identify three challenges. First, a number o them had difficulty 
		adjusting to working as part of a team.</font></b></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>As patrol officers, many had worked 
		specific heats and precincts, and had become intimately familiar with 
		the community and streets. Once in the gang unit, they had to know the 
		entire city, or at least those areas where the gang unit frequently 
		worked. (Finally), [s]ome officers found working with gang members, 
		their families, and friends to be more challenging than expected. </b>

	</blockquote>
	<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">In <a name="Closing"> Closing</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Gang units may have conflicting or poorly articulated goals, but most
    have a common purpose - to conduct investigations, develop intelligence, and
    use the intelligence to address the local gang situation. While all the
    police gang units I studied used suppression (arrest) as their primary
    method of dealing with gangs, some used deterrence, education, mediation,
    and/or diversion and referral. </p>
	<p>How are officers trained to accomplish the many duties and tasks assigned
