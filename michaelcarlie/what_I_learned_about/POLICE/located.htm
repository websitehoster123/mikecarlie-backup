<p>The way in which police departments organize to address a community's gang 
situation varies considerably. Some departments don't organize at all. Officers 
in patrol, narcotics, juvenile, and other units may stumble upon gang members or 
gang intelligence and may or may not share it for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>What is a &quot;gang unit?&quot; According to Katz, McGuire, and Roncek <font size="1">
(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Katzetal2002">Katz</a>, 
et. al. 2002)</font>, &quot;a police gang unit is a secondary or tertiary functional 
division within the parent police organization, with at least one sworn officer 
whose sole function is to engage in gang control efforts.&quot; </p>
<p>Some departments assign an officer to work gangs while, in other departments,
an officer volunteers to work gangs because of his or her own personal interests.
There are departments with one gang unit and officers who are spread across the
various shifts through the day and night. And there are departments with an entire division dedicated to
working gangs. Within that division there will likely be individual units assigned to deal with
Hispanic, African-American, Asian, or other ethnic gangs depending upon the
make-up of the local gang population. And each unit may have three
different shifts of officers.</p>

	<p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>It should not be 
	surprising that police departments have chosen to create specialized gang 
	units to focus, consolidate, and coordinate their gang control efforts, 
	since a number of reasons have been offered to suggest that specialization

	all of the gang units that we studied organized their units in the same way.

<p>
If there is a police gang unit, where is it located in the police
department's structure? This is an important question and the answer
to it reveals a great deal about the department's administrators, their outlook
on their community's gang situation, and more. Is the gang unit independent - unattached to any other division or unit
in the department? Or is it attached to the narcotics unit, juvenile division, 
Special Operations Division (as in the Las Vegas Police Department), the Special 
Enforcement Bureau (as in the Albuquerque Police Department), or the Organized 
Crime Bureau (as in the Phoenix Police Department)?&nbsp;
The answer to this question reveals how the gang problem is being
defined by the police administrator, the likely response of the police
department to the community's gangs, and the public's perception of its local
gangs and their activities.<br>
<br>
It is popular today to associate gangs with drugs. To this, Malcolm Klein,
with over 30 years of gang research under his belt, wrote that when the crack epidemic hit L.A. in the early 1980s,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2"><b>The police and press
version was that street gangs were ideal mechanisms for drug distribution. Gangs, it was said, were tightly organized, with a well-defined
leadership, fierce internal loyalty, and well-established territories that they
defended through violence. This gang image fit the needs of drug, or
crack, distribution very neatly. Except that this is not what most
street gangs are like. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Klein1995">Klein</a>, 
  1995, pp. 16-17).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the extent of gang-related drug crimes, placing a police gang unit inside a narcotics unit
<i>
defines the gang problem as a drug problem</i>. Because the anti-gang effort
is placed in the narcotics unit, drug laws become the doorway to
gangs and gang members will be
arrested for drug law violations. In turn, through press releases and
newspaper articles, the community will come to know its community's gang issue <b>
as a drug issue</b>.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if the police gang unit is aligned with the department's
juvenile division, gang members will be detained (juveniles are detained, adults
are arrested - it's the same consequence, just called by a different name) for
violations of delinquency laws. In this community, residents will come
to know the gang issue <b> as a juvenile delinquency issue</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<a name="1899"></a>The <i> orientation</i> of the gang unit may also be a result of where
the unit is located in
the department's structure. My experience suggests gang units attached to narcotics units are
more punitive and reactive in
their approach to gang members than are units attached to the juvenile division.
Police gang units associated with a juvenile
division are more proactive and treatment oriented in their approach. This
is understandable given the original purpose for the creation of the American
juvenile justice system.</p>

        Differences in Philosophy between the American Juvenile Justice System
        and the Criminal Justice System</font></font></b>
        <p><b><font size="2">The American juvenile justice system is an
        outgrowth of the first juvenile court which was created in Cook County
        (Chicago), Illinois, in 1899. As the philosophy of the American juvenile justice system took shape
        it was determined that, whereas the criminal (adult) justice system
        demanded all proceedings be
public, juvenile proceedings were to be held in <font color="#008000">private</font>. It was believed the stigmatization and labeling resulting from holding proceedings in
public would hinder a youth's ability to overcome his or her deviance.<br>
<br>
Whereas the justice process for adults was formal (i.e., trials, verdicts),
the process for juveniles was to be <font color="#008000"> informal</font> (i.e.,
        hearings - not trials, findings - not verdicts, no jury). Being informal allowed the court/judge to respond to a deviant youth with
compassion and understanding. The court could be more flexible in its response
and would be concerned more with the &quot;welfare of the child&quot; than with
simply imposing punishment.<br>
<br>
        This brings us to the third major difference between the criminal and juvenile
justice systems. The criminal (adult) justice system was based upon the
        philosophy that adults knew what they were doing when they violated the
        law and needed to be punished in order for their behavior to be altered.
        The juvenile justice system is based upon the belief that <font color="#008000">young
        people can be rehabilitated</font> without resorting to punishment. They
        needed treatment.&nbsp;</font></b>
        <p><b><font size="2" color="#008000">The association of a police gang unit with the police juvenile division, then,
is more likely to exhibit a treatment orientation.</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

<p>
Placement of a police gang unit in the narcotics division, on the other hand,
suggests a punitive approach. In departments where the gang unit
stands alone, the orientation is more likely to be varied and may depend upon
the wishes of the unit's commander, the officers which serve on the
unit, the community's wishes, the influence of local politics, or a combination of
all these forces and others.</p>
<p>As related to intelligence, I noticed that gang units associated with
narcotics were less likely to have good intelligence on gang members who were
minors (not adults). Gang units associated with juvenile units, on the
other hand, had intelligence on the minors. This is an important
distinction since intelligence on minors in gangs means police may be able to
identify youths who can be helped before they become too involved with a gang.</p>
<p>Where is the gang unit located in the community? Some police gang units work 
out of the department's headquarters and/or substations. Others are off-site, 
located in the community but with addresses unknown to the public. Some move 
from time to time to keep their location secret.</p>
<p>Referring to three of the four police department gang units they studied, 
Katz and Webb noted that &quot;The locations were kept secret, and as a result, were 
unavailable to the public, community leaders, and other criminal justice 
officials.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 214)</font> My own inclination is 
to be critical of this latter policy because it further separates the community 
(which, in the end, is the body that is going to have to address the underlying 
causes for gang formation and gang joining) from the police gang unit officers. 
For intelligence to flow from gang situation to police to community, there must 
be contact and communication. Off-site locations hinder such communication.</p>
<p>Compounding the exclusionary effect of having a gang unit located off-site is 
further separation of the gang unit from the department due to the individual 
gang unit officer's&nbsp; autonomy. Katz and Webb found that &quot;Some gang unit 
officers commented that they enjoyed special status within the department 
because of the many benefits they received while in the (gang) unit. For 
example, some noted, no supervisors looked over their shoulders; they were 
self-directed in the field; (and they worked in individual cubicles.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp; 229)</font></p>
<p>We've been looking at where the gang unit may be located in a department or 
the community and
what the consequences of those locations are. Now we'll take a look at the purpose
of a gang unit.</p>
