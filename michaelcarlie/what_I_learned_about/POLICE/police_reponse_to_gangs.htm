			<p align="left">In April of 2004, Charles M. Katz and Vincent J. 
			Webb conducted a rather remarkable and very useful study of police 
			gang unit responses to gangs. It is entitled <i>Police Response to 
			Gangs: A Multi-Site Study, </i>and was funded by the United States 
			Department of Justice. In an email dated December 31, 2004, Dr. Katz 
			indicated that the book will eventually be published by the 
			Cambridge University Press. </p>
			<p align="left">The police gang units Katz and Webb observed 
			were those in Inglewood (CA, population 112,580), Phoenix (AZ, 
			population 1,321,945), Las Vegas (NV, population 478,434), and 
			Albuquerque (NM, population 448,607. The size of those departments' 
			gang units (in 2004) ranged from 4 officers (Inglewood) to 41 
			officers (Las Vegas) while the number of sworn officers in the 
			entire police organization ranged from 210 in Inglewood to 2,532 in 
			Phoenix (the 10th largest police agency in the United States.
			<font size="1">(<a href="http://faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp;35)</font></p>
			<p align="left">In addition to reading newspaper articles and 
			documentation provided in official reports and interviewing external 
			stakeholders (people in the community who had a vested interest in 
			the gang phenomenon), Katz and Webb interviewed a total of 65 of the 
			90 gang unit officers available in their research cities and an 
			additional 20 police managers and supervisors. <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp;43)</font></p>
			<p align="left">One of the key differences about Katz's and Webb's 
			study is that the gangs in the cities they studied were 
			predominantly comprised of Mexican Americans and Mexican 
			Nationals, as opposed to the African-American or Asian gang 
			populations found in other cities. Due to the rapidly increasing 
			size and diffusion of Latino peoples throughout the United States, 
			Katz's and Webb's study is both timely and relevant.</p>
			<p align="left">Because I believe the findings of Katz's and Webb's research 
			are so important, I will summarize their findings here, although 
			there are many more of their findings reported throughout <i>Into the Abyss</i>. What follows is a brief summary of the highlights of 
			Katz's and Webb's study. It includes the <b>goals and objectives of 
			the study</b>, its five <b>major findings</b>, and a statement on <b>
			how to improve the effectiveness of police gang units</b>.</p>
			<p align="left">Katz and Webb stated the <b><font color="#800080">
			goals and objectives of the study</font></b> <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp;i) </font>as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>1. To identify and examine the 
				factors that have led to the creation of specialized police gang 
				units, and to examine how those factors have influenced the

				<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>2. To examine alternative ways 
				in which police agencies have organized resources to respond to 
				their local gang problems;</b></font></p>
				<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>3. To examine the relevant 
				beliefs of gang unit officers, and how their beliefs might have 
				affected the police response to gangs;</b></font></p>
				<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>4. To identify the activities 
				that gang unit officers have been engaging in, and to clarify 
				conceptually the roles of specialized police gang units within 
				their departments;</b></font></p>
				<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>5. To assess the goodness of 
				fit of the police response to gangs with the community-oriented 
				policing paradigm.</b></font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p align="left">The study concludes with <b><font color="#800080">
			five major findings</font></b>, all of them of significance for law 
			enforcement agencies hoping to effectively deal with the gang 
			problems they face. <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp;ii)</font>&nbsp; As will be seen in the 
			remaining pages of this chapter, the problems noted in the major 
			findings above have, to a significant degree, crippled or otherwise 
			hindered law enforcement's efforts to gain a stronghold on the gang 
			phenomenon.</p>
			<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">First Finding: </font>
			<font color="#800080">Police gang units were an indirect response to 
			an objective problem</font></b></p>
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Although all cities in our 
					study had gang problems at the time that their respective 
					police departments established gang units, in creating the 
					gang units, the police departments typically were responding 
					to <i>political, public, and media pressure</i> - not 
					directly to the objective reality of the gang problem. 
					(Italics in original.) </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. ii)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="left">When reading research on gangs, one will find 
				the argument that police officials, the media, and city 
				administrators may create an image of gangs for the community 
				that &quot;demonizes minority and other marginalized youth, in an 
				effort to campaign for additional resources.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. ix)&nbsp; </font>In the four cities 
				Katz and Webb studied they found no evidence of such 
				manipulation. </p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Furthermore, we found no 
					evidence suggesting that police had created the gang units 
					to control marginalized populations who they perceived as 
					threatening; rather, we found evidence to the contrary. Much 
					of the data suggested that minority communities played a 
					major role in shaping the nature of the police 
					organization's response to gangs. </b></font><font size="1">
					(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. ix)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="left">In reality, the researchers found that community 
				members were criticizing police for not taking enough action to 
				reduce the gang problems in their respective communities.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">Second Finding: </font>
			<font color="#800080">There was an absence of control and 
			accountability over the gang unit.</font></b></p>
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>The data showed that few 
					formal mechanisms had been instituted for controlling and 
					managing gang units and their officers, or for holding them 
					accountable. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. ii)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="left">At three of the four research sites the 
				researchers found a lack of gang-unit-specific &quot;policies, 
				procedures, or rules guiding officer behavior, and the few 
				policies and procedures that did exist were modest in scope and 
				nature.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp;x) </font></p>
				<p align="left">As a result, they found gang unit officers were 
				poorly trained on gang-related matters. On-the-job experience 
				was what passed for &quot;training&quot; and, as might be expected, 
				resulted in producing several problems affecting investigations, 
				the handling of intelligence, and their ability to provide any 
				meaningful insights to policy planners and members of the 
				community.</p>
				<p align="left">As if to compound matters and make them worse, 
				the researchers found that &quot;the gang units ... lacked adequate 
				performance measures ... and were hard pressed to offer specific 
				evidence of the units' effectiveness.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. x)</font> As a result, &quot;this casual 
				approach to performance measurement ... contributed to a sense 
				of autonomy and lack of accountability within the gang units.&quot;
				<font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. x)</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">Third Finding: </font>
			<font color="#800080">Information was the principal commodity of 
			gang units.</font></b></p>
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>The most important 
					benefits to actors in the gang units' environments were 
					related to the production and dissemination of gang 
					intelligence. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p.&nbsp;ii)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="left">Other than the gang unit officers and other law 
				enforcement stakeholders, &quot;almost no one ... believed that gang 
				unit suppression efforts were effective at reducing the 
				communities' gang problems.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. xii) </font>In fact, the 
				researchers found that the gang unit officers they studied 
				averaged only one to three gang member contacts for every eight 
				hour shift worked. And most of those contacts did not result in 
				an arrest. Instead, intelligence was gathered - the commodity 
				most valued by internal stakeholders (members of other units, 
				divisions, and bureaus within the police department). </p>
			</blockquote>
			<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">Fourth Finding: </font>
			<font color="#800080">Decoupling of gang units from the rest of the 
			police organization was problematic.</font></b></p>
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>The police had 
					structurally and strategically decoupled gang control 
					efforts from the rest of their police organizations. </b>
					</font><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p&nbsp; ii)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="left">The researchers found that the decoupling 
				(disconnecting) of the gang unit from the rest of the 
				enforcement agency was the most typical long-term outcome of the 
				creation of a gang unit. As they note, &quot;This resulted in several 
				negative consequences, limiting the capacity and effectiveness 
				of the units.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. xiii)</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="left"><font size="2">Operational activities 
					carried out by the officers tended to be decided upon in 
					accord with the unique workgroup subculture that existed 
					within each gang unit, a subculture that reflected 
					internally shared beliefs about the nature of the local gang 
					problem and the appropriate response to that problem. </font>
					<font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. xiii)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="left">The gang unit's perception of the &quot;nature of the 
				local gang problem and the appropriate response to that 
				problem,&quot; however, often did not match the community's 
				perception of the problem and what it would consider the 
				&quot;appropriate response.&quot;</p>

				<p align="left">The researchers found that the decoupling of the

				<p align="left">As Katz and Webb note, the exploits of the Los

				<p align="left">As Katz and Webb note, violations like those

			<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">Fifth Finding: </font>
			<font color="#800080">Police gang units did not practice community 
			policing.</font></b></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left">Traditional local law enforcement finds police 
				in a reactive mode. That is, they wait for a call for service 
				and react by arriving on the alleged crime scene and, when 
				appropriate, making an arrest. The emphasis today in law 
				enforcement circles is to become more <i>pro</i>active - to 
				prevent crimes from occurring. Community-policing is a proactive 
				form of policing (while still including reactive law 
				enforcement). The core features of community-policing include 
				&quot;citizen input, geographic focus (on a crime-ridden 
				neighborhood, for example), emphasis on prevention, partnerships 
				(with community organizations and citizens), formal problem 
				solving&quot; (such as the SARA Model), and greater officer 
				discretion. <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz

				<p align="left">Given the importance of prevention within the

				<p align="left">One of the major premises of <i>Into the Abyss</i> 
				is that, for police to be effective with gangs, there must be a 
				police-community connection. A partnership. In its absence, the 
				police are working alone and fail to obtain needed information, 
				cooperation, and other resources available to them from most 
				communities.</p>
				<p align="left">I have worked with a community-wide gang task 
				force for several years and continue to find information-sharing 
				in the group of great value, as do most of the law enforcement 
				personnel who serve on that task force. What Katz and Webb 
				found, however, is indicative of too many law enforcement 
				agencies in the United States. They state that &quot;None of the gang 
				unit officers in any of the study sites appeared to value 
				information that <i>non</i>-criminal justice agencies might 
				provide, nor did they recognize potential value in sharing their 
				own information and knowledge with non-criminal justice 
				personnel.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz 
			and Webb</a>, 2004, p. xv. Italics in the original.)</font> 
				I believe devaluing any source of information as an error - 
				particularly if the sources are agencies with knowledge of 
				gangs.</p>
				<p align="left">And failing to share intelligence with 
				non-criminal justice personnel leaves many in the community 
				without any direction or guidance as to what it is the community 
				needs to do to effectively address the gang phenomenon. </p>
				<p align="left">None of the gang units Katz and Webb studied 
				participated in prevention or problem-oriented policing. The 
				gang unit officers did not believe those activities were their 
				responsibility. Addressing the problems underlying the gang 
				phenomenon fell out of their purview. Instead, the gang units 
				took a reactive view to policing gangs rather than a proactive 
				one. &quot;We found that the gang units simply did not routinely 
				consider formal problem-solving strategies as a means to address 
				their local gang problems.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz
