    <p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Which is Best?</b></font></p>
    <p>Which definition of gang crime is best?&nbsp; Gang-motivated or
    gang-member based?&nbsp; The following definition of each has been drawn
    from Candice M. Kane's <i><a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Kane1992">Prosecutor:
    Technical Assistance Manual</a>.</i></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Gang-Motivated</b></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this procedure, according to the Chicago Police Department, a criminal
    act is defined as a gang incident if it grows out of gang motivation,
    interest, or specific circumstances that enhance the status or function of
    the gang. These acts include: inter-gang violence, gang retaliation, turf
    protection, intimidation, robbery, recruitment, or other criminal activity
    that affects the gang's reputation or interests as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One or more members of the gang may be involved as a suspect, witness,
    offender, or victim in these circumstances. In classifying the incident,
    focus is on the nature of the specific situation in which the illegal act
    occurs, such as a drive-by shooting or the yelling of a gang slogan in the
    course of the crime.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Crimes such as burglary, car theft, prostitution, and drug trafficking by
    a gang member are problematic because it is hard to determine whether the
    act is gang-motivated. Many criminal acts serve individual member needs
    unrelated to gang interests.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On the other hand, seemingly individual or self-serving crimes by gang or
    aspiring gang youth may be gang-motivated. For example, a youth may be
    required or feel compelled to commit a particular property or person crime
    because of pressures by the gang.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Gang-Related</font></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This procedure, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,
    is based on the characterization of a crime or delinquent act as a gang
    incident when the suspect, offender, or victim is a gang member, regardless
    of gang motivation or circumstances. Usually any serious criminal act,
    especially of a violent, predatory, or drug trafficking nature, in which a
    gang member is involved, can be classified as a gang incident.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, the crime of a gang member who steals from a store--even
    though that act has nothing directly to do with his gang membership--would
    be classified as a gang-related incident. (See Appendix B for a discussion
    of mixed situations and erroneous classification of group delinquency as
    gang crime.)&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Which Definition to Use</font></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The argument in favor of using the gang-motivated definition is that it
    focuses sharply on the circumstances of the incident rather than the
    identification of the individual as a gang member. It may be more precise
    and valid than the gang-related definition. It withstands court challenges
    better. It also avoids excessive labeling or exaggeration of the gang
    problem.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The counter-argument is that the gang-motivated definition minimizes the
    actual scope of the gang crime problem. It may encourage organizational or
    community denial of the problem. A key assumption of the proponents of the
    gang-related definition is that a gang member is likely to engage in a wide
    range of serious crimes because gang membership predisposes him or her to do
    so. Evidence for this argument is not substantial, however.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Police and prosecutors generally believe that it is desirable to identify
    gang members and their activities as completely as possible. Police are
    particularly concerned that the full range of criminal activities of the
    gang member be available for efficient tracking and investigation
    purposes.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We recommend a procedure that avoids excessive labeling of youth but
    ensures protection of the community. A gang-incident procedure should be
    devised that records and distinguishes between gang- motivated and non-gang-motivated
    crime committed by the gang member. All serious criminal incidents by repeat
    gang offenders should be clearly &quot;flagged&quot; on criminal justice
    computer systems. An effective computerized information system permits use
    of either or both procedures to track gang-motivated incidents and gang
    member crime.</p>
