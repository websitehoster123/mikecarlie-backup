    Search and Seizure<br>
    </font>
    </span><font color="#800000"><font size="2">by Patrick Fagan, 1997<br>

    <p>The United States Supreme Court and a few U.S. Appeals Courts have
    adjudicated cases that revolve around search and seizure. Proper knowledge
    of this issue will increase success in court for the law enforcement
    officer. Several judicial reviews have been used in this article to form a
    small guide for the police who effect search and seizures upon individuals
    and vehicles.</p>
    <p>Often at the crux of a search and seizure is probable cause—apparent
    and reliable facts that create a reasonable belief that a crime has been or
    is being committed. Officers may now be held liable for technicalities
    stemming from lack of probable cause. In Malley v. Briggs(1),
    the Supreme Court decided that the police are not entitled to absolute
    immunity from civil damages. A Rhode Island state trooper acted on a
    court-approved wiretap that entailed the following short conversation:
    Caller says, “I can’t believe I was token in front of Jimmy Briggs”
    — caller states he passed it to Louisa. Paul says, “Nancy was sitting in
    his lap rolling her thing.” Information gleaned from the wiretap
    culminated with the arrest of at least twenty people but with no indictment
    from the grand jury. The Chief Justices ruled that the trooper had failed to
    establish proper probable cause to justify the affidavit. Although a judge
    had authorized the warrant, a reasonable police officer should have known
    that in this instance probable cause was insufficient. The police may no
    longer rely blindly on the authority of a magistrate.</p>
    <p>In any occurrence, articulable facts must be distinguished before
    enacting a stop, and these facts must be expanded before a search and
    seizure is conducted. A person may not be immediately searched once he is
    detained. However, Terry v. Ohio(2)
    allows for a protective pat down of a person’s clothing when suspicious
    activity alerts the officer to some danger. Any search under Terry v. Ohio
    must be used to discover weapons, though, not evidence of a crime.</p>
    <p>In Minnesota v. Dickerson(3),
    the defendant was seen evasively leaving a building known for cocaine
    traffic. The officers ordered the man to stop and submitted him to a pat
    down.
    A lump was detected in a coat pocket and manipulated by an officer during
    the probe. The object was removed and identified as cocaine. This stop and
    pat down was ruled constitutional, but the seizure of the drug was
    suppressed. The officer never thought the lump to be a weapon; therefore,
    the continued exploration of the pocket was unconstitutional. Only after its
    illegal removal was the lump recognized as cocaine.</p>
    <p>In Sibron v. New York(4),
    a patrol officer observed Sibron in a restaurant with three known addicts.
    Sibron was taken to the street by the officer to be questioned.. This
    officer had not overheard any of Sibron’s conversation nor had he
    witnessed any exchanges between Sibron and the addicts. Nevertheless, Sibron
    was searched and heroin was retrieved from his pocket. The Supreme Court
    ruled that no probable cause existed before the search, so the officer’s
    justification to search for weapons was derogated. Chief Justice Warren
    clarified the case succinctly:</p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><font size="2">The
    police officer is not entitled to seize and search every person whom he sees
    on the street or of whom he makes inquiries. Before he places a hand on the
    person of a citizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally
    adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so. In the case of the
    self-protective search for weapons, he must be able to point to particular
    facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and
    dangerous.</font></b></p>
    <p>To further examine the thin line as to what constitutes legal or illegal
    probable cause, the Supreme Court adjudicated Brown v. Texas and Michigan v.
    DeFillippo. In Brown v. Texas (5),
    two police officers arrested a man who refused to identify himself and
    explain what he was doing in an alley. The premise for the arrest was a
    Texas statute that makes refusal of identity and address a criminal act.
    However, the person must be lawfully stopped. The officers claimed that the
    man had been approaching another bystander but upon observing the police, he
    walked away in the opposite direction. Chief Burger stated that if any
    suspicion of misconduct was missing, “the balance between the public
    interest in crime prevention and appellant’s right to personal security
    and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
    conviction was overturned.</p>
    <p>Michigan v. DeFillippo(6)
    was a similar case. Detroit police happened upon a man and a woman in an
    alley. The woman was in the process of lowering her pants. Under a local
    ordinance, police had the right to ask for identification in peculiar
    situations such as this. Officers requested identity from the man, which was
    adamantly refused. The police then conducted a pat down, which produced
    narcotics. Chief Burger believed in this case that the officer had abundant
    probable cause. He noted that the respondent’s “presence with a woman in
    the circumstances described clearly was behavior warranting further
    investigation under the ordinance, and respondent’s responses to the
    request for identification constituted a refusal to identify himself as the
    ordinance required.” In this instance the conviction was upheld.</p>
    <p>Courts have not avoided automobile searches either. This type of
    investigation often results in confusion with its applicability, but
    warrantless searches may be conducted when they follow a lawful arrest or
    when probable cause has been gathered.</p>
    <p>New York v. Belton(7)
    negated much of the confusion that derived from automobile searches.
    Belton’s search was based on an examination of the passengers’
    compartment that began after the occupants had been legally arrested and
    placed in handcuffs on the sidewalk. A jacket containing cocaine was then
    discovered inside the car. The Supreme Court found this search to be
    constitutional and incident to a lawful arrest. Justice Stewart ruled that
    police can search a passenger compartment of cars in any similar situation.
    They may also examine the contents of any containers found inside that
    compartment. Any container within may also be searched whether it is open or
    closed, because the “justification for the search is not that the arrestee
    has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial
    arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may
    have.” The Justice went on to define a container as “any object capable
    of holding another object. It includes closed or open glove compartments,
    consoles, or other receptacles located anywhere within the passenger
    compartment, as well as luggage, boxes, bags, clothing, and the like.”</p>
    <p>United States v. Ross(8)
    involved a much more extensive search. An informant gave District of
    Columbia police a drug dealer’s description. The police also received
    information that the dealer stored narcotics in his vehicle. This vehicle
    was later located which precipitated the driver’s arrest. An officer
    opened the trunk. Then he seized and opened a sealed paper bag that
    contained heroin. The car was then driven to the local precinct where
    another search—detailed but warrantless—instituted more inculpatory
    evidence. Chief Justice Stevens said the following in the Court opinion:</p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="2"><b>Where
    police officers have probable cause to search an entire vehicle, they may
    conduct a warrantless search of every part of the vehicle and its contents,
    including all containers and packages, that may conceal the object of the
    search. The scope of the search is not defined by the nature of the
    container in which the contraband is secreted. Rather, it is defined by the
    object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to
    believe that it may be found. For example, probable cause to believe that
    undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a
    warrantless search of a suitcase.</b></font></p>
    <p>Collectively, the Court ruled that police in a legitimate stop of a
    vehicle, and who have probable cause that illegal items are somewhere
    within, may conduct a warrantless search. The search can be as powerful as
    though it were issued by a magistrate. Some guidelines for the probable
    cause were established:</p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><font size="2">The
    probable cause determination must be based on objective facts that could
    justify the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate, and not merely on the
    subjective good faith of the police officers. As we have seen, good faith is
    not enough to constitute probable cause. That faith must be grounded on
    facts within knowledge of the officer which in the judgment of the court
    would make his faith reasonable.</font></b></p>
    <p>California v. Acevedo(9)
    augmented the New York v. Belton case. A man carrying a small paper bag was
    seen leaving an apartment known for cocaine activity. He placed the bag in
    the trunk of his car. After driving away, police stopped the vehicle and
    opened its trunk. The officers seized the bag and identified the contents as
    marijuana. This case entitled police to conduct a warrantless search of any
    container within an automobile if that container was thought to contain
    incriminating evidence. In this instance, police had only probable cause to
    search the bag, not the entire vehicle. Where a Belton search should follow
    a lawful arrest, Acevedo grants a search of containers premised on probable
    cause.</p>
    <p>The Chief Justices did not give an acceptable time lapse between the
    actual arrest and the vehicle search. However, in United States v. Sharpe(10)
    the Court announced that police must pursue the investigation diligently for
    a detention to remain permissible. In this case, the complainant was
    detained for 20 minutes before the beginning of the vehicle’s search.
    Still, the Supreme Court believed that the officer who conducted the matter
    did so with no intentional delays. Also, in Florida v. Royer(11)
    the Court held that “an investigative detention must be temporary and last
    no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.” For a
    comparison, United States v. Place(12)
    dealt with a detention that lasted for 90 minutes. A man’s luggage was
    seized until a narcotics K9 was brought to the airport to confirm
    officers’ suspicion of criminality. The police had prior knowledge of the
    man’s arrival but had not prepared for the possible use of a drug dog.
    Place was reversed.</p>
    <p>The US Supreme Court has endured criticism that it is handcuffing the
    police with search and seizure restrictions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>To the contrary, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the consent
    to search has become a very effective and important part of <i>legal</i>
    search and seizures. This investigative tool is a boon from the higher
    courts to the police in that it returns power for conducting warrantless
    searches to patrol officers. That power is limited, but it is still powerful
    and can be quite effective. It is more of a gift when one realizes that
    suspects often grant permission to conduct a search regardless that they are
    actually concealing incriminating evidence. Unlike other aspects of search
    and seizure, the consent to search is not littered with technicalities that
    protect criminals.</span> Nevertheless, an improper consent must be and can
    be avoided with the study of several cases.</p>
    <p>The consent to search must be wholly voluntary. It may not be coerced or
    implied in any manner. A trooper in South Carolina received some skepticism
    from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding his investigative ploy in
    United States v Lattimore(13).
    The trooper stopped Lattimore for speeding and then requested consent to
    search Lattimore’s vehicle. Permission was granted verbally by Lattimore
    to conduct the search, but the trooper asked him to sign a consent form
    anyway. Lattimore signed it. The trooper conducted a search and discovered
    95 grams of cocaine base and other drug paraphernalia.</p>
    <p>While Lattimore and the trooper sat in the patrol car to prepare the
    written consent, the trooper’s video camera recorded the following
    conversation:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: Okay, you
    gave me a verbal consent, . . . this is written consent, okay. Let me
    explain this paragraph right here. Says I have [in] no way forced you,
    threatened you, . . . or compelled you ‘til [sic] I may search your
    vehicle. You understand that?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Lattimore</b>: Mm- hmm.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: I need your
    signature or an X on the bottom. Again, it’s just giving me consent.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Lattimore</b>: On that,
    what’s the difference on that?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: What [do]
    you mean?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Lattimore</b>: If I say
    yes or I say no, it’s still ....</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: Well, let me
    explain something to you. I’m on a special team. I travel around the
    state. This is all I do. I search-</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Lattimore</b>: Uh- huh. I
    was watching that on . . .</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: - - 97
    percent of the cars I stop. It don’t matter if you’re 18 to 80 years
    old, you’re black, white, red, Indian, Hispanic. I don’t care what you
    are. That’s all I do. You say you saw it on the news?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">[The two discuss a
    television program showing highway patrol officers.]</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Lattimore</b>: Yeah, and
    I seen where [sic] they pulled a guy over, and they, you know, asked him the
    same thing you’re asking me- - whether they could search his car or not.
    And, um, what’s the difference? If you do or you don’t, it’s gonna
    happen anyway, right?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: Not really.
    If you don’t, I feel you’re hiding something. Therefore, I’ll call a
    drug dog right up the road to come down here and let him search your car.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Lattimore</b>: That’s
    what I’m saying. It don’t really make no difference.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: Well,- -</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Lattimore</b>: That’s
    what I’m saying.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><b>Trooper</b>: - -
    there’s certain reasons why we do that.</p>
    <p>Although Lattimore’s conviction was upheld and his consent deemed
    valid, the court remained wary with part of the trooper’s audio. Even if
    the trooper had exceeded the proper limits for requesting the written
    consent, which it did not, the Court claimed that the oral consent had been
    legally established. It was United States v Thompson(14)
    that declared refusal of written consent does not revoke oral consent.
    Therefore, it was the trooper’s remark concerning the drug dog that
    aroused the Court’s skepticism. The Court stated:</p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><font size="2">In
    view of the Government’s concession that Trooper Frock did not possess the
    reasonable suspicion necessary to detain Lattimore to permit the drug dog to
    sniff his automobile, if Lattimore had not already given a voluntary oral
    consent to the search, Trooper Frock’s assertion that he would ‘call a
    drug dog’ to search the automobile if Lattimore refused written consent
    would raise serious questions concerning the voluntaries of his consent.</font></b></p>
    <p>Lattimore had also claimed that his detention was illegal because he was
    stopped for a traffic violation and that the trooper had no adequate
    probable cause to investigate for additional criminal activity. The Court
    disagreed because the trooper requested consent after the citation was
    issued and the ensuing conversation was consensual. Thus, the Court believed
    that Lattimore was not being detained and that a reasonable person would
    have felt free to decline the trooper’s request.</p>
    <p>Another situation involving when a detainee may feel free to leave arose
    in Ohio v Robinette(15).
    Robinette was asked permission to search his car after a speeding citation
    was issued. This case caused a great deal of controversy, for it appeared
    that thousands of motorists were being delayed and subjected to a “fishing
    expedition.” Despite some evidence that patrol officers in Ohio were
    searching vehicles just to practice their “drug interdiction technique,”
    the Supreme Court said that no officer had to inform a detainee beforehand
    that the detainee was free to leave.</p>
    <p>In Bumper v North Carolina(16),
    the police were not as fortunate. The consent given was gained by coercion.
    Mrs. Leath, the petitioner’s grandmother, was approached by four law
    enforcement officers and informed that they had a warrant to search her
    residence. The warrant was not read to her and she never saw this warrant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>She still allowed the police to conduct a search that eventually
    produced incriminating evidence. At trial, the prosecution asserted that
    although the police had a search warrant, the search was conducted based on
    Mrs. Leath’s affirmative consent. The Supreme Court did not concur:</p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><font size="2">When
    a prosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a
    search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely
    and voluntarily given. This burden cannot be discharged by [391 U.S. 543,
    549] showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><font size="2"> A
    search conducted in reliance upon a warrant cannot later be justified on the
    basis of consent if it turns out that the warrant was invalid. The result
    can be no different when it turns out that the State does not even attempt
    to rely upon the validity of the warrant, [391 U.S. 543, 550] or fails to
    show that there was, in fact, any warrant at all.</font></b></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><font size="2">&nbsp;When a law enforcement
    officer claims authority to search a home under a warrant, he announces in
    effect that the occupant has no right to resist the search. The situation is
    instinct with coercion—albeit colorably lawful coercion. Where there is
    coercion there cannot be consent.</font></b></p>
    <p>Thus far, only issues regarding consent to search&nbsp;that was granted
    by the individual in question have been discussed. One should also consider
    the guidelines pertaining to a second-party consenter. These guidelines
    usually cause a dilemma that contains two court phrases: mistake of law and
    mistake of fact.</p>
    <p>Mistake of law is discussed in United States v Whitfield(17).
    Whitfield’s mother refused to sign a written consent form but allowed FBI
    agents to conduct a search of her son’s room. The agents had confirmed
    that Mrs. Whitfield owned the home, her son was not paying rent, and his
    bedroom door was not locked. Accordingly, the agents believed that they had
    received legal consent. The Circuit Court of D.C. disagreed, however. This
    appellate court proclaimed that although the agents truly believed Mrs.
    Whitfield could gave consent, the agents had misinterpreted the law in this
    situation because the mother had no authority to allow a search of her
    son’s room.</p>
    <p>Mistake of fact is discussed in Illinois v. Rodriguez(18).
    Rodriguez had apparently beaten his girlfriend, Ms. Fischer, who had called
    the police from her mother’s house. Ms. Fischer told the police that
    Rodriguez was at <i>their</i> apartment and took the police to it. She took
    a key from her purse, unlocked the door, and let them in. In the process of
    arresting Rodriguez, the police observed, in plain view, cocaine and other
    drug paraphernalia. It was learned at trial that Ms. Fischer had not lived
    at Rodriguez’s apartment for at least a month, she had never contributed
    to the rent, and she never told Rodriguez that she had a key to his
    apartment. The Supreme Court held that these instances were mistakes of fact
    and that the police reasonably believed Fischer could give a legitimate
    consent.</p>
    <p>A similar situation developed in People v Kramer(19).
    Because Kramer was past-due three months with his rent, his landlord entered
    Kramer’s apartment and saw some marijuana plants. Upon arrival, the police
    were immediately taken to the apartment. Kramer was subsequently arrested.
    The appellate court ruled that the police only assumed the landlord had
    legal access to the apartment. Since landlords are not usually the proper
    authority to grant a search of a tenant’s property, the police officers’
    assumption was a mistake—a mistake of not gathering enough facts. The
    court warned that “police officers may not always accept an invitation to
    enter premises. Even if the consenter claims to live on the premises, the
    officers must make further inquiry if the surrounding circumstances would
    raise a doubt of that claim.”</p>
    <p>Search and seizure is a powerful tool for law enforcement but one that
    any person would take as a personal affront. Law enforcement personnel must
    be educated with the legal and illegal procedures of this investigatory
    process. This procedure is taken very seriously but the courts and the
    legislature because search and seizure is so intrusive. For example, in
    1995, a measure was introduced to the House of Representatives that would
    change the Fourth Amendment somewhat. This bill would have allowed
    unlawfully seized evidence to be considered in court if police had any
    reasonable belief that they were acting legally. The bill was rejected
    soundly with a vote of 303 to 121.</p>
    <p>Search and seizure of the individual and of the automobile is a complex
    issue in which the rules change often. Decisions of the US Supreme Court and
    appeals courts involving the Fourth Amendment purport to guide police
    conduct. Notwithstanding, the police should view the determinations of these
    courts as a learning tool and continually educate themselves.<br>
