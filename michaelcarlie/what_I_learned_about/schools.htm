    In many of the school districts I visited it was common to find school drop
    out rates of from 10% to 40%, even in Europe and Canada. Drop out
    rates can vary significantly from one neighborhood school to another and, while there is no conclusive evidence that dropping out
    of school is related to gang
    formation, what we do know is highly suggestive such a relationship.&nbsp;<p>

    <p>Schwartz's findings are stunning, and troubling. School failure (whether the
    result of poor performance or dropping out or both) has potentially
    devastating effects upon the affected student and the society in which he or she
    lives. Schools may also be failing the students. Curry and Decker <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#CurryDecker1998">1998</a>)</font>,
    quoting William Julius Wilson (1985, p. 37), stated that&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>&quot;a vicious cycle is perpetuated through the
      family, through the community, and through the schools.&quot; In the
      vicious cycle portrayed by Wilson, schools fail communities and
      communities fail schools. Schools fail communities by not educating and
      graduating their students. ... Communities fail schools by not providing a
      safe community environment in which teachers can teach and students can
      learn and by not providing school administrators with the fiscal or policy
      resources needed to overcome a growing host of problems. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#CurryDecker1998">Curry

    <p align="left">This brief review of the status of our nation's children in
    regards to their schooling, and a reminder of the relationship between
    school failure and delinquency, shall serve as a means of introducing what I
    learned while visiting schools during my field research.</p>
    <p align="left">There are tens of thousands of elementary-, middle-, and high
    schools in the United States. I visited only a few of them, but they
    made a significant impression on me regarding gangs. The
    schools I visited included traditional middle- and high schools as well as
    alternative middle- and high schools. They were all in cities of
    from 150,000 to 500,000 residents and were located in or near gang
    territory. I've chosen a few of the schools to write about below as representative
    of
    all the schools I visited.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Park Middle School</font></b>
    </p>
    <p align="left">Park Middle School is in a rough part of town. The
    children are primarily Caucasian or African-American. Few Hispanics or
    Asians have moved into this
    school's neighborhood as yet.
    </p>
    <p align="left">When drive-by-shootings occur in this city, they are likely
    to take place in the vicinity of this school. The principal told me &quot;We give
    students who throw signs, write graffiti, or dress like they are gang
    members just one warning to change their behavior. The next time
    we give them a three day suspension. Not one parent has
    complained about having their child suspended for gang-related behavior, and
    we have <i> lots</i> of parents who complain when we do it for other reasons.
    And
    we have a very high suspension rate. What they do, however, is say 'My child is not in a gang' or in some way deny the situation.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">Among other things, I was curious about the nature of the
    relationship between the Caucasian and African-American students in the
    school and asked the principal about that. &quot;We have a lot of prejudice
    here,&quot; she said. &quot;That's the reason for some of our suspensions. The 'N' word
            [nigger] is said much too often and, if a student is caught
    saying that word he is suspended from school for three days.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">The school has two programs for students who are suspended, and about 90% of them
    participate in either one or the other. Students suspended for
    ten days or less are sent to an alternative school so few class days are missed.
    At the alternative school, however, behavior problems demand more staff
    attention than would be found in a traditional classroom. This limits the
    amount of time spent on traditional school topics at the alternative school.
    </p>
    <p align="left">If the suspension is for a longer period of time - and it may be for an
    entire semester - the principal sends the children to a different alternative school, one
    where they attend classes and have a prolonged treatment program. Both of
    these alternative schools are in the same facility, but each is run
    differently.

            pride in describing the program preceded our visit.</font></b>
            <p><b><font color="#0000FF" size="2">As we approached the school building
            he opened the front door for me and, as I stepped into the front hall, I was greeted by a rather curious scene. One of
            the teachers was rolling around on the floor with a throat hold on
            one of the students. Shouting and screaming accompanied the
            scene as the teacher attempted to bring the student under his
            control.</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <p align="left">The principal told me &quot;Only a few kids stay home rather than attend either of those programs.
    We practically require they attend. And we offer them
    all a ride to the program and provide them with a bus pass to
    get back home each day.&quot;
    </p>
    <p align="left">I visited a middle school in Kansas City which implemented the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program (G.R.E.A.T.)
    in the 7th grade classes. Police officers taught the eight one-hour long
    lessons. I told the principal about the program and she responded
    saying &quot;Having someone in the classroom who gets all the kids
    talking about things that might prevent them from getting involved in gangs
    or gang-like behavior is a good idea. We should be doing that.&nbsp;But you'll have a difficult time getting something like that implemented in
    this town. We have some members of the School Board who would find
    that intrusive. They would say that 'The students' <i> parents</i> should be
    talking to them about <i> those</i> kind of things. That doesn't belong in
    the school curriculum!'&quot; Her frustration was evident as she
    raised her voice and slapped the table to punctuate her assessment of the
    situation. Her level of concern and
    passion for her students was obvious.

    of federal funds.&nbsp;We just got a new principal at the high school and she
    cares a lot about the kids and about education. So she wants this and that. She's rocking the boat and the school board
    doesn't like that. It looks like they're going to get rid of her.

    <p align="left">There seems to be a ray of hope at Park Middle School, however, and it comes in the form of a program called
    Helping Communities. The principal said &quot;It offers students many opportunities for healthy growth,
    involvement, and is generally seen as a positive force in the life of the
    students, the school, and the surrounding community. My greatest
    fear is that the program will not be permanently funded, but will stay under
    the control of our Democratic governor. And if we get a
    Republican in next time, he or she may stop the funding. That's a
    terrible thought. We'd lose a lot of good programming.&quot;

    years old. You can imagine the level of parenting skills they had as a

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="alternative"></a>Flores Alternative Middle School</font></b>
    </p>
    <p>Flores Alternative Middle School has a student body that is mostly Hispanic
    and is located in a neighborhood which, over the past 20 years, transformed
    from a poor Caucasian neighborhood to one dominated by Hispanic residents.
    Like most alternative schools, it's students are those who were removed from
    traditional schools due to poor academic performance or behavioral problems.
    </p>
    <p>Miguel is Hispanic and serves as the school's primary counselor and
    social worker. We visited for several hours after taking a tour of
    the facility. He began to refer to the &quot;gang mentality&quot; as
    he described the situation in the school and the surrounding
    community. I asked what he meant by that term and he replied &quot;It's a value system
    that each gang member holds and shares with fellow gang members. It is
    in opposition to general society's value system.
    </p>
    <p>&quot;The gang value
    system supports negative attitudes towards the law and holds in high regard
    those who violate the law. It supports the belief that the
    individual is more important than the whole and that, if a given action does
    not benefit the individual, it is not worth doing. On the other
    hand, it is ethnocentric [believing one's own culture is the best of all
    cultures] and sometimes fosters group loyalty. It's the way gang members look at the
    world - a world view that effects their attitudes and behavior.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>Miguel's biggest concern is getting the Hispanic youth at the school out of
    the gangs to which they belong. &quot;I finally got a chance to talk
    with some of them,&quot; he said, &quot;after I befriended one gang member.&quot;
    Once he won the respect of the gang member, some of the other gang members began to talk to him and
    shared their concerns.
    </p>
    <p>He learned that many of the
    gang members were upset because adults in the community would not allow them to use the
    community gym. The adults were afraid to allow them in the
    facility because of the way they behaved, dressed, and moved - &quot;They
    were afraid of them and of the damage they thought they would do to the gym,&quot;
    Miguel said.
    </p>
    <p>He told the gang members he would gain access to the gym for them, and
    he did. But he told them if they want to use it, there were
    rules they would have to follow - no fighting, drinking, or selling
    drugs. They agreed and within two weeks forty-five of them were playing basketball at
    the gym three or four nights a week.
    </p>
    <p>&quot;Since only ten could play at a time, I started talking with
    the other ones on the sidelines and in the bleachers. Instead of doing
    counseling formally, I just listened and offered honest advice,&quot; he
    said. He found the gang members he talked with were listening
    to him, as were those sitting nearby, &quot;even though they acted like they
    weren't listening. That told me a lot about my being accepted and their
    interest in being helped.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>In time, Miguel formed a basketball league
    and, as more youths came to play he noticed the Hispanic girls were beginning to attend as spectators.
    Sitting
    on the bleachers, he started the same process of informal counseling with
    the females. Then he started an all-female volleyball team.
    </p>
    <p>One of the most important insights Miguel offered that day had to do with
    his perception of gang members - at least the ones he knows. He said
    &quot;The person we see as a gang member is not the real
    person. When threatening situations are removed and the real person is
    allowed to emerge, the gang member may be seen as having the same values,
    dreams and desires as those of the rest of us in society.&quot; There may be
    some gang members who are, for all intents and purposes, beyond redemption.
    But there are also some who could be redeemed.
    </p>
    <p>A 19-year veteran of the local police department, herself Hispanic,
    joined us for part of the interview. She agreed with that statement. &quot;The way they behave around us, sometimes, is because we're police and
    they have to show they aren't frightened and they're in
    control. Otherwise they look bad. And when they're around me,
    being a woman, that's very important. Machismo is everything!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>According to Miguel, within months of implementing the sports teams, the
    amount of crime and violence in the neighborhood decreased. &quot;Then rival gangs began to attack
    the
    gang members,&quot; he said &quot;because they saw them as weak.&quot; He asked the
    police department to
    help by cracking down on the
    attackers, but the police refused.
    </p>
    <p>Other communities have found police to be helpful in working with the
    children as well as staff, teachers, and administrators in the
    schools. One of the most popular programs is called the School
    Resource Officer program.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">The School Resource Officer program (SRO) is a
      nationally accepted program involving the placement of a law enforcement
      officer within the educational environment. The officer, while in school,
      is involved in a variety of functions aimed at prevention. Besides being
      an active high profile law enforcement officer, the SRO is a resource for
      students, parents, teachers and administration regarding law issues.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Another duty for the SRO is being a link to other service agencies which
      provide preventive and counseling services within the school district.
      Working hand in hand with the Principal in each school, the SRO assists
      with finding solutions to problems affecting school age children ...</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The SRO program is a proactive approach to deal with
      the pressures today's young people find themselves having to confront.
      This includes the use of alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, along with peer
      pressure, gang activity, and sex. These situations are not only in the
      schools, but in the community as well. The approach of addressing these
      issues only in the school, or only in the community, has not been
      completely effective. Traditionally, police and school did not interact
      until one called upon the other.</b></font><font size="1">  (Emmet

    </blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Brooks High School</font></b></p>
    <p>The principal of the school said &quot;Brooks High School has gangs and their presence has been escalating.
    Our
    approach to reducing the gang presence relies heavily on three things: a
    partnership with the police, strict no tolerance rules, and treatment. We've built a partnership between us and the police department. This
    includes working with the School Crew [a special unit within the juvenile
    division of the police department]. The School Crew knows how to work
    with troubled kids and they try to help them and work with their
    families. They visit problem students in their homes and seek treatment
    for them in community-based social service agencies whenever appropriate. We also have strict rules and regulations.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
    <p> At that point the
    principal handed me a copy of the booklet every student receives when they
    initially enroll in
    the school. &quot;It's pocket size,&quot; he said, &quot;so they won't lose it!&quot;
    The booklet is from the city's Board of Education and is entitled <i>Students' Rights and
    Responsibilities</i>. Students
    are required to sign for their copy and to have their parents sign in hopes they
    also will read it.</p>
    <p>&quot;And we have a no tolerance policy here regarding guns and drugs,&quot;
    he added. &quot;And all of this has resulted in less gang activity.&quot;
    The no
    tolerance policy (violators of the school's rules and regulations are
    punished for every violation) was described as working in conjunction with
    the police department's Gang Unit. The principal feels &quot;That
    gang unit is one of the best things that has happened. The
    Chief (of Police) is keeping the community aware of the
    problem, putting resources where they are needed, and is helping
    reduce the gang problem.&quot;</p>
    <p>In addition to providing enforcement, treatment provided by the liaison
    School Crew detectives is essential (i.e., visiting with troubled students and
    their parents, seeking out help in the community).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Regardless of all his efforts, &quot;Gangs are still active in the
    school,&quot; he lamented. &quot;When a student who's in a gang misses even one class
    (which is a violation of the rules and regulations of the school), it's used like the police use probable cause.
    We build a case for removing the
    child from the school. Then we remove him. If we don't practice
    zero tolerance then none of this will work.&quot;</p>
    <p>At the end of the interview I asked the principal if he had any other
    comment he'd like to make. He said &quot;I think the gang problem is due, in
    part at least, to the
    fact that we've been soft-shoeing the problem - not being strict or
    punitive enough in dealing with gang members.&quot;</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Wilson Alternative High School</font></b></p>
    <p>According
    to a Wilson High School brochure, &quot;Wilson's purpose is to support
    students who have experienced difficulties in the regular school setting, to
    promote self-esteem, to encourage students to remain in school through
    graduation, and to prepare them for their fullest participation in our
    changing society.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>While waiting for my appointment to interview the principal
    I asked for permission to wander about the school. Among other things,
    I visited several of the classrooms. On the black board of one room were the names of
    several government
    offices and a list of topics including home
    ownership and home loans, creating and managing a personal budget, decision
    making, family planning, child rearing, and more. The course that
    is taught in this room is called &quot;Life Skills 101.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Elsewhere was a hallway wall covered with paint-coated images of students' hands.
    Each student signed his or her name under the
    impression left by their hands. Hanging in the hallways were huge
    signs and posters with sayings such as&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#0000FF"><b>Think
    Straight A's! &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>

    <p align="left">A visit to the gymnasium revealed the school
    holds an annual &quot;College and Career Fair&quot; and banners from
    each year's Fair hung from the rafters displaying a list of names of each 
    year's graduates. Later I was
    to learn that graduation ceremonies are held each academic quarter rather
    than each semester due to the unending waiting list of students wanting to
    enroll.</p>
    <p align="left">The halls were lined with racks of brochures dealing with
    
    subjects such as sexually transmitted diseases, the consequences of getting
    involved in alcohol and illegal drugs, and the rights of individuals
    involved in traffic court cases.</p>
    <p align="left">A prominently displayed calendar of events announced birthdays,
    field trips, an upcoming &quot;Holiday Extravaganza&quot; and an &quot;Art
    Fest.&quot; There are regularly scheduled events each month of
    the academic year.&nbsp;Posters announcing various special events at area
    colleges and universities were displayed everywhere mixed with art work
    created by the students. I saw all of this as symbolic of not
    only the school administrator's genuine interest in the development of the
    students, but as a symbol of ownership and&nbsp; pride on the part of the
    students. There wasn't a piece of trash to be seen anywhere in the
    school. Not one piece. I looked!</p>

    windows, well kept grounds, an intimate atmosphere, and a small student body.
    With 20 to 80 graduates a year, students receive a great deal of
    personal attention and are typically known, by name, to each teacher and to
    the principal. In fact, while I was interviewing her, Dr. King saw a
    student walking out the front door of the school and called to him by his first
    name.</p>
    <p align="left">He turned around and walked back into her office, head hung
    low.&nbsp;She asked &quot;Where are you going?&quot; He explained there was an emergency at home.
    She warned him
    &quot;I'm going to call your mom while you're on your way just to make sure
    everything's okay. Okay?&quot; He thanked her and left the
    room. We both assumed that, under the circumstances, there really must
    have been an emergency at home.</p>
    <p align="left"><a name="nursery"></a>Dr. King told me she &quot;graduated from high school in
    the 1960s. Back then, we didn't have
    nurseries in our community's high schools. So, I was surprised,
    at least at first, when I saw a classroom in Wilson which had been converted
    to a sixteen-crib nursery, complete with paid staff, volunteer baby sitters,
    baby seats, lots of toys, tumbling mats on the floor, and
    beautiful babies and infants being fed their Gerber's.&nbsp; Things
    have changed since my time. And without this service, how many of the
    students at Wilson would have to forego their high school education?&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">On the wall in the main hallway outside the nursery, tacked 
    to a cork bulletin board, is a
    display of baby pictures. I counted 34 pictures containing, in all, the faces of 37 babies and
    37 proud mothers,
    mostly Caucasian. Only one picture showed an adult male or apparent father with the
    baby. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">I asked Dr. King if the display honored and
    encouraged teen pregnancy and, hence, became a part of the teen pregnancy
    problem, or if it acted as a caution against getting pregnant. After telling
    me that &quot;Lots of people have asked that question,&quot; and that there are
    others&nbsp;who have asked to have the material removed from display, Dr.
    King defended
    the exhibit noting &quot;We love our students and expect them to love
    and care for their children. We certainly don't encourage teen pregnancy! That would be silly. But we do encourage our
    teen mothers to love and care for their children and that's why we have the
    pictures up there.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;I'm not afraid of these kids. We just gave a year's
    suspension to a student who was found carrying a knife into our building. I will not tolerate that, regardless of the excuses he gave as to why
    he had the knife. And we've had only one fight in my eleven years
    here. Only one case of graffiti. And if you look around,
    you'll see the building and grounds don't have
    trash on them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;These kids (at Wilson) haven't had a reality check yet. They resolve their problems out there using violence and no one gives
    them a reality check. They have to be willing to listen to us for
    ideas as to how to manage as an adult. Violence is not an
    acceptable answer, and they haven't been getting that message.&quot; In
    fact, Dr. King said &quot;Abuse is common in our students' lives.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> Hoping to get some clarity as to what kind of abuse they suffer I
    recited a list of them including sexual, psychological, verbal, physical
    and neglect. She just looked at me and said &quot;Lots of all the
    above. We have a significant drug problem here. The most common drug is marijuana.&quot;
    I asked what drug is the second
    most common and she said it was alcohol. She said methamphetamine, crack, PCP, and LSD are drugs
    that some students use sometimes. She did not think they
    used heroin. Wilson has its own drug treatment program, in addition
    to programs offered in the community.</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;Our biggest problem,&quot; she said, &quot;is simply getting the students in the
    school building door. Once we get them in, we can usually keep them
    and keep them safe.&quot; I asked Dr. King about the student she was
    visiting with before our interview. She told me
    &quot;She's about seventeen years old
    and has been sexually abused by her father since she was eight years old. The
    mother doesn't live at home and the entire family is in denial about that
    alleged behavior. These are the kinds of things we deal with every
    day.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">She told me about a male student who lives with his mother. His
    mother's boyfriend was killed in that home. The student had to clean the blood
    off of the floor after the boyfriend's body was removed. She
    asked me &quot;What
    do you think this does to a young boy? We have
    to work with children who live in a world of violence. And we
    have students from wealthy area families who are spoiled by their parents. Rather than giving their children a reality check, they fly them to
    the family resort or to the beach.&quot;</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>&quot;So many of our
      children are disenfranchised, so the gangs pick them up. The
      disenfranchisement is from family, school, religion, and from the
      neighborhood as well.&quot;</b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">
      (Mariah Wheeler, Alternative High-School School Principal)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mariah Wheeler is a middle-aged Caucasian woman who once lived in the
    inner city of this community of nearly one-half million people - &quot;Right
    in the midst of the crime and gangs,&quot; she told me. &quot;Now I live on
    the north side of town. It's relatively free of such things.&quot; She
    is the principal of an alternative high school in the inner-city and
    occupies an office that is eight feet by six feet - about the size of a
    prison cell.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The building, at one time a church, was converted to a school several
    years ago when most of the congregation moved out of the neighborhood. Now the
    buildings are surrounded by a residential neighborhood filled with a variety of ethnic groups
    including those that
    have been in the neighborhood for several years and newly arriving
    groups including Russians and Somalians.</p>
    <p>The school provides free clothing and food to the area's poor, offers technical counseling for newly arrived immigrants, and
    provides housing placement services for them. The student body is
    comprised solely of youth who have been thrown out of the city's other high
    schools.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> According to Wheeler, &quot;Most of the Mexican and
    African-American students are thrown out of public school because of
    behavior problems, not because of grades or because they have something
    wrong intellectually. Students are referred here by probation and parole officers, teachers at
    the other schools, and by parents. Most of the children are from
    racial and ethnic minority groups including Mexicans, Bosnians, and
    African-Americans. Only a few Asians and Caucasians attend.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When asked if there was a gang problem in the community, Wheeler hesitated
    for a moment then said &quot;Yes, there is. There's conflict between gangs
    from the East side of town and the West side of town, occasional graffiti,
    and we have to take away books and notebooks from students if they put gang
    graffiti on them. It's our policy. We also eject known gang affiliates from
    school.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Wheeler told me the drop out rate for the city's public schools is nearing
    40%. I was not surprised. I was surprised the first time I heard
    about drop out rates when I began my research. Buy by the time I
    interviewed Wheeler I had been in the field for over a year and the shock
    had worn off. Given the extent of the gang situation in Wheeler's
    community, the drop out rate seemed about right.</p>
    <p>I inquired about the gang situation in the school. &quot;We have a
    problem.&nbsp; The problems are 'wannabes' and neighborhood gang members.
    Gangs are in the school and difficult to get out. It's in their attitude
    towards studying and school in general. I sometimes have to caution my
    students who are not in a gang. They dress like gang
    members as part of the 'Hip Hop culture' but I warn them &quot;Dressed like
    that you are a target for rival gang members and you might get
    hurt.&quot;</p>
    <p>The school is located directly across the street from a neighborhood once
    known for prostitution. &quot;Prostitutes bodies were being found
    floating in the river,&quot; Wheeler said. The area is now marked for
    development and Wheeler hopes this will improve the situation around the
    school.</p>
    <p>The newly arrived immigrants living in the neighborhood behind the school
    have not yet learned to speak English. &quot;Their
    children speak little English,&quot; she said, &quot;but they are learning. But they are not going
    to school. Instead, they're hanging out in the neighborhood and look
    like a gang now.&quot; She told me she's been hassled by one member of
    the &quot;gang&quot; who is only eight or nine years old.</p>
    <p>When asked about the relationship of her students with the city police she
    said &quot;It's not good.&quot; It gets better for a while when the
    police come to the school under positive circumstances - like making auditorium
    presentations. This is good in two ways. The police get to know the
    students better and have even left saying to me that 'These are good kids!,'
    and the children get to see the police in a positive setting. That's
    good. The children look scared when the police first come in, but then
    it gets better when they see they aren't in trouble. But our black
    kids don't like the police. They have had bad experiences with them and have
    told me about some of those experiences.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As to probation and parole officers, Wheeler said &quot;In general, the relationship
    between them and our students is good.&nbsp;But like anything else, there
    are good probation and parole officers and bad ones.&nbsp;They are all
    overworked and have a hard time doing their job as well as they would
    like.&quot;</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Gang Recruitment and the Schools</font></b></p>
    <p>Schools are a prime target for gang recruiters. The more recruits a gang 
	member can bring into his or her gang, the more prestige that gang member 
	has within the gang. The most highly regarded recruiters, according to 
	Curtis Sliwa <font size="1">(from a conversation with him on 12 March 2005),</font> 
	are encouraged by their fellow gang members to continue to do well in school 
	so that they aren't thrown out. After all, it's much more difficult to 
	recruit students into a gang if you're not in school to recruit them! Sliwa 
	should know, he is the founder and President of the Guardian Angels and has 
	working with and against gang members for over 25 years in New York City and 
	other major gang venues.</p>
	<p>Children attending schools are a captive audience in that, at least from
    5- or 6 years of age to 16 years of age, they are supposed to be there. Where else could a gang recruiter encounter as many youth with so little
    supervision?</p>
    <p>Public and private schools report gang recruitment taking
    place in the school buildings, on school grounds, and in their immediate
    vicinity.&nbsp; Recruitment practices include handing out flyers (most
    common with supremacist and Neo-Nazi gangs), displaying graffiti, verbal
    communication, and intimidation. Several states have passed anti-gang-recruiting legislation
    in hopes of reducing such behavior.&nbsp; Oklahoma's legislation provides an
    example.</p>

    <p>According to the well weathered principal of an alternative high school,
    making an observation on schools throughout the nation, &quot;We need to be proactive
    now. We've been reactive - reacting to the poverty, the abuse, and
    those things.&nbsp;It's time to be proactive and prevent these things from
    happening. Each of
    these kids have such a full plate.&nbsp;I respect them for the fact they can handle all these things that are happening to them and still get up
    in the morning and hope for something positive to happen. They
    really try hard.&nbsp;And I sometimes think they like for me to rag [pick] on
    them. They need and want the discipline. Look, for
    lots of these kids their decision-making skills on a good day aren't worth
    a shit.&quot;</p>
    <p><a name="Schouten2003"></a>As pertains to the link between the quality of education students are 
    receiving and racial/ethnic segregation of our schools, on January 19, 
    2003, the Gannett News Service reported that</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">[American] ...schools are becoming increasingly 
    segregated. Although the country is growing more diverse and minority 
    enrollment is nearing 40 percent at public schools, more than 70 percent of 
    black and Hispanic students attended predominantly minority schools during 
    the 2000-2001 school year.</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>The report, &quot;<a href="http://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/reseg03/resegregation03.php">A 
    Multiracial Society with Segregated Schools: Are We Losing the Dream,</a>&quot; 
    also shows that 2.3 million black and Hispanic children - or about 5 percent 
    of the public school population - attend what the researchers term 
    &quot;apartheid&quot; schools, where virtually all students are minority.</b></font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">This &quot;resegregation&quot; of public schools is undermining 
    the quality of education minority children receive... Segregated schools 
    tend to have fewer qualified teachers and less challenging coursework than
