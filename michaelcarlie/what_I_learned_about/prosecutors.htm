    <p>Prosecutors, sometimes referred to as District Attorneys, represent the

    suspected criminal offenders. When prosecutors believe a case has <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#merit">prosecutorial merit</a>

    for <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#Probable Cause"> probable cause</a> in the arrest of the suspect and
    reveal the evidence
    against the accused. Judges then determine if there are

    <p>When it comes to the subject of gangs, prosecutors do not work in a void. Their world
    includes several
    other players, including those who work toward community-wide efforts to
    reduce gang activity. Community
    mobilization is an effort on the part of an entire community to address
    various social problems - including gangs. Mobilization efforts may include
    generating opportunities for job
    training and placement and for social intervention efforts (i.e.,
    substance abuse intervention, counseling, education, reducing abuse in the
    home).&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>Social
      disorganization, which contributes to the development of criminal youth
      gangs, may be characterized by the inability of legitimate institutions
      such as home, school, and employment, to adequately socialize youth. It

      fragmentation of criminal justice or community service delivery systems,

    <p>These strategies complement the prosecutor's suppressive efforts (to

    <p>In the end, &quot;A community's youth gang problem will not be reduced in
    the long term solely by arresting and prosecuting gang
    members. Other things must take place in order to create opportunities for gang- and
    gang-prone youth and to involve community residents in an effort to improve
    the conditions of their neighborhoods.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Kane1992">ibid.</a>,

    <p>In larger jurisdictions there may be several, if not scores, of
    prosecutors. It is not uncommon for a chief prosecutor to create
    special units within his or her office. These units are established
    depending upon the nature and extent of certain crimes occurring in the
    community.&nbsp;Examples of special units are Major Crimes (i.e., murders, mass murders), Sexual Assault and Child Abuse, Sexually Violent Predator, Statutory
    Rape, Elder Abuse, Child Abduction, Crimes Against Persons (i.e., robbery, assault), Crimes Against Property
    (i.e.,
    larceny/theft, burglary), Major Fraud, Organized Crime, Criminal
    Racketeering, Asset Forfeiture, and Family Violence.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>It is essential that

    <p>Some prosecutor's offices have one or more units dedicated to prosecuting
    gang-related offenders. In communities with a significant and chronic gang
    situation, there may be different prosecutorial units for Asian, Hispanic,
    African-American, and other ethnic group gang cases.</p>
    <p>Much of what follows below was drawn from a nation-wide survey of prosecutors
    conducted by Johnson, Webster, and Connors.<font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">1995</a>)</font>
    They mailed survey instruments to a total of 368 State prosecutors' offices
    in all 175 counties with more than 250,000 residents. An additional
    193 prosecutors were randomly selected from counties with from 50,000 to 249,999
    residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 80% of prosecutors from the large counties and 84% of those
    from small counties responded to the survey. That is an exceptionally high
    rate of return. In addition to the surveys,
    four on-site visits were made to study how the prosecutors dealt with street gangs
    in different cities and States. The researchers' findings were significant and are
    useful in our discussion of prosecutors, courts, and gangs. <font color="#008000" size="1"><font color="#008000">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">Johnson,
    Webster, and Connors</a>, 1995, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/pgang.txt">page</a>)</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Vertical">Vertical</a> Prosecution</font></b></p>
    <p>Rotation and vertical prosecution are two methods prosecutor's use to
    manage the cases that come to their attention. Using the rotational method,
    as each case comes to the prosecutor's office it is assigned to the next available
    prosecutor. Using vertical prosecution, cases are assigned to specific
    prosecutors or groups of prosecutors based upon the nature of the case.
    Sex-related cases go to the sex-crimes prosecutors, murder cases go to the
    prosecutor's homicide or major crimes unit, and so on. Vertical prosecution is one of the
    keys to the successful prosecution of gang member offenders and it works like this ...&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">A police officer makes an arrest and, in his investigation, determines
    the offense may be gang related (committed by a gang member or motivated by the
    suspect's gang). The case is then brought to the prosecutor's office
    and assigned to a designated gang prosecutor. That same prosecutor
    takes the case forward for all subsequent hearings and right on through to
    trial and possible sentencing. <i>Vertical</i> means the same prosecutor stays
    with the case from beginning to end as opposed to having different
    prosecutors take the case through each of the various steps in the process
    (the rotational method).</p>
    <p align="left">The nation-wide survey of prosecutors referred to above<font size="1">
    </font>found that</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Prosecutors favored vertical prosecution of
    gang members and believed that a small group of gang prosecutors using this
    approach may be the more effective strategy. </font></b><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">ibid.</a>,
    1995, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/pgang.txt">page</a>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Vertical prosecution is important in gang-related cases because it allows
    for continuity and may result in obtaining important information
    for prosecuting the current case and future gang-related cases. As one
    prosecutor put it, &quot;The prosecutor gets to know the case in greater
    depth, including the accused, victims, and the evidence that will be used
    in court. By being at all the hearings I have a much better idea of
    what is happening with the cases.&quot;</p>

    <p>Where the gang situation has become entrenched and chronic, some
    prosecutors have adopted a proactive approach to the prosecution of gang
    members. Rather than wait for serious gang crime cases to work their way
    through from the police, prosecutors join police on the street
    interviewing witnesses and victims of serious gang crimes. An example of this
    proactive, aggressive and pre-emptive form of prosecution may be
    found in California where, according the Johnson, Webster, and Connors <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">1995</a>)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Several jurisdictions surveyed combined vertical with

      <p><b><font size="2">One San Diego assistant district attorney explained

      gang prosecutors who handle murder cases. On these most serious crimes,
      the district attorney's office does not wait for cases to make their way

    <p>In their nation-wide survey of prosecutors, Johnson, et. al. found that &quot;Prosecutors
    cited problems in prosecuting juveniles (a large percentage of gang members)
    because State juvenile codes were not designed for the serious violence that
    characterizes street gang crime, and gang statutes generally do not cover
    juveniles.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">ibid.</a>, 1995)</font></p>
    <p>The prosecutors also identified what they saw as new and needed areas of 
    legislation. Among them was allowing greater accessibility to juvenile 
    records. As noted by Johnson, et. al. <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">1995</a>)</font>,
    &quot;State juvenile codes were not designed for the serious violence that
    characterizes contemporary street gang crime, and the gang statutes almost
    completely overlook juveniles. Often, the prosecutorial response to this
    difficulty is to seek transfer of serious juvenile offenders into adult
    court and correctional systems. But such transfers may be very difficult to
    obtain because of strong traditions favoring adjudication and treatment of
    juveniles within the juvenile court and corrections systems.&quot; <font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">ibid.</a>,

    about why judges stay off the streets, one Major Crimes Unit supervising prosecutor

    <p>There are judges at the juvenile level who are concerned
    about youth involved in gang activity. According to Spergel,
    this is a special problem and
    juvenile court judges should &quot;understand the scope and seriousness of the
    youth gang problem and ... deal with juvenile gang offenders in the juvenile
    court rather than [transfer] them to adult court.&quot;<font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SpergelChance1994">Spergel,
    et al.</a>, p. 9, 1994)</font></p>
    <p>During the late 1980's and into the 1990's, Spergel and some of his
    associates conducted research on gangs funded by the U.S. Office of Juvenile
    Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The research group was to &quot;undertake a
    comprehensive assessment of gang problems and programmatic responses across
    the country.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SpergelCurry1994">ibid.</a>, 1994)</font> In relation to the courts, the researchers found&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">The court has directed little attention
      to special approaches for dealing with juvenile or youth gang offenders.
      Instead, the judiciary emphasizes a get-tough strategy, and more often
      removal of the serious juvenile gang offender from the jurisdiction of the
      juvenile and family court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">However, some judges try to use the
      court as a basis for a community-oriented approach in which a variety of
      community, school, family, and justice system organizations concentrate
      efforts to address the special needs of the youth gang member.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Although many judges pursue a broad
      social rehabilitation or protective approach with respect to abused and
      neglected children and minor offenders, little consideration is given to
      adapting such an approach for juvenile gang offenders.&nbsp; </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SpergelCurry1994">ibid.</a>, 1994, p. 9)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Although several years have passed since Spergel's findings were
    reported, the situation has not improved. Instead, the number of gang
    members has been steadily increasing (from 378,807 in 1993 to about <a href="GANGS/demographics_number.htm#number">846,500
    in 1999</a>), placing an even greater burden upon the court and all community-based

    <p>In order to successfully prosecute gang members there must be an
    adequate number of police in the police department. Police are often overwhelmed by the number of calls for
    service to which they must respond, the amount of time it takes
    to investigate cases, write reports, and do all the other things
    police are expected to do.&nbsp;Without a sufficient number of police, departments can not pursue
    gang-related cases thoroughly. And without the in-depth police
    investigations needed to successfully prosecute suspected gang members,
    prosecutors' hands are tied.</p>

    <p>According to Johnson, et. al., &quot;Prosecutors' offices in
    which victim advocates work in tandem with investigators also reported
    considerable success with gang-related cases.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">Johnson,
    Webster, and Connors</a>, 1995, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/pgang.txt">page</a>)&nbsp; </font>They provide an example of such
    work in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">The Suffolk County, Massachusetts, prosecutor's gang
      task force has a victim advocate and an investigator who both spend their
      time dealing directly with victims and witnesses in gang cases. The victim
      advocate regards this job as a significantly different kind of advocacy.
      The clients are primarily young adults ages 17 through 23.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Handling these cases requires extensive personal
      contact; notices and telephone calls are not enough. The victim advocate
      prepares witnesses for trial, reviews grand jury testimony with them, and
      reviews the district attorney's questions. Since many witnesses in gang
      cases do not have telephones, the advocate often goes to their homes to
      remind them of court dates and, if necessary, wakes them up and transports
      them to court.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Because of close and consistent contact with victims
      and witnesses, the victim advocate also effectively serves as a fact
      finder for the gang prosecutors. The Multnomah County victim-witness
      advocate also emphasizes that personal contact is very important to
      success in this work.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">An aggressive victim-advocate program, one that
      contacts the victim and witnesses immediately and develops and maintains
      their cooperation, can be one of the most significant factors in
      successful prosecutions.</font></b><font size="2"> </font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">ibid.</a>,

    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Questionable">Questionable</a> Outcomes</font></b></p>
    <p>Most
    prosecutors I encountered believed suppression was not the
    answer to the gang phenomenon. They believe suppression is only one of several
    elements which need to be in place to reduce gang activity. On the
    other hand, when suppressive efforts are taken and include strict
    supervision and opportunity provision (offering education and employment
    opportunities) in the community, there are often
    questionable outcomes.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>When defendants are
      found guilty, it may not always be in society's interest to incarcerate
      them for a very long period. The prosecutor's sentencing recommendation to
      the court should be based on the probation officer's presentence
      investigation as well as the possibility that strict supervision in the
      community and appropriate programming through remedial education and job placement
      may have longer term social benefits for both the community and the
      youthful offender than a prison sentence. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SpergelChance1994">Spergel,
      et al.</a>, 1994)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The problem is that in too many jurisdictions, strict supervision in the
    community - typically meaning probation - is not possible. Probation
    personnel are overwhelmed by large and complex caseloads matched only by the
    amount of paperwork which is required of them on a nearly daily basis. Strict supervision is not possible without confinement, and confinement only
    complicates matters for the gang member (i.e., exposing them to negative
    influences, possible harm, further gang involvement).</p>
    <p>As Johnson, et. al., found:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Once cases reach the courts, prosecutors are often
      frustrated with several factors that hamper the prosecution of gang
      members. Though it appears that sentencing enhancements might lessen the
      recycling of gang members through the criminal justice system, the State's
      resources must be considered in pursuing such enhancements.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Gang members, especially juveniles, sometimes pass
      through the system without serving any sentence. Problems that have always
      existed within the juvenile justice system make gang prosecution
      especially difficult because so many gang members today are
      juveniles.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Prosecutors expressed frustration with the
      effectiveness of the juvenile justice system in handling juveniles
      involved in gang crimes. Where criminal justice officials contend with a
      shortage of detention facilities, juveniles--even those with prior
      convictions--may receive only intensive probation for a felony charge. In
      such a situation, sentencing enhancements and stricter penalties will have
      little effect on the gang problem.&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2"> </font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">Johnson,
    Webster, and Connors</a>, 1995, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/pgang.txt">page</a>)</font></p>

    <p>Johnson, et. al.<font size="1">,&nbsp; </font>found, the prosecutors who responded to
    their survey were not optimistic about gangs in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">In their work, they have learned a great
    deal about gangs, gang members, and the circumstances that have produced
    them. The gang members who come to their attention are often far beyond the
    reach of social interventions designed to deter youths from involvement in
    gang or drug lifestyles.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Although they stated that prosecuting
    gangs would not completely solve the gang problem, they intend to pursue
    prosecutions as vigorously as possible. But as indicated by their comments
    on the survey questionnaire and in interviews, gang prosecutors consistently
    advocated early intervention with children and youths and more effective
    services to strengthen families as the best way to prevent gang crime and
    violence. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">ibid.</a>,
