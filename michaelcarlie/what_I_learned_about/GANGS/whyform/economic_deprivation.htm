    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Gangs, Economic Opportunity, and
    the Inner-City</font></b>
    </p>

    <p>Many gang-dominated neighborhoods in the United States may be characterized as having a
    disproportionate number of residents who are unemployable, unemployed, or
    underemployed. They are areas characterized by a lack of economic
    opportunities, poverty, inadequate
    city services, struggling school systems, and are home to a significant segment of
    the city's minority and/or new immigrant
    populations.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>When businesses move out from the inner-city, and new businesses develop in the suburbs rather than in the inner-city, inner-city
    residents are left with a declining number of legitimate opportunities to work and make
    a living. In Wilson's<font size="1"> (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Wilson1996">1996</a>)
    </font>study of the new urban poor he reports on conditions in inner-city
    Chicago. A senior typist he interviewed said
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>[We] need funding to get businesses in the area. A big
      grocery store would generate more jobs and enable people to shop more
      safely and without fear.&nbsp;</b></font>
    </p>

    </blockquote>

      <p>A 91-year-old woman spoke of safety concerns:
      </p>

    <blockquote>

      <p><font size="2"><b>It's not safe anymore because the streets aren't. 
      When all the black businesses and shows closed down, the economy went to 
      the dogs. The stores, the businesses, the shows, everywhere was lighted,

    <p>According to Wilson, this inner-city environment takes its toll in many ways. One of his subjects
    spoke of her need to move her child away from home just to protect him from
    the gangs.

      shoes off his feet. They took his clothes. Made him walk home from school.

    <p>Economic opportunities, economic deprivation, and the quality of life in

      <p><font size="2"><b>The inner cities also suffered from the flight of

      stayed behind, inner-city neighborhoods became mired in concentrated
      poverty. The result, Wilson argues, was a new &quot;underclass&quot; of

    neighborhood. Concentration effects increase the likelihood of being

    <p>In addition to decimated business areas, poorly managed public housing stands out in my mind as
    one of the
    most common characteristics of an inner-city gang neighborhood. I am not suggesting
    all public housing is dominated by gangs, only that gangs are often found
    in neighborhoods with poorly managed public housing. These neighborhoods provide limited opportunities for gainful
    employment - particularly for young people. In stark contrast, a suburban youth
    can find
    part time employment in any one of a number of his or her neighborhood groceries, restaurants,
    shops, and department stores.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The increase in the gang problem, at least partially,
      is the result of the unemployment and underemployment of minority males;
      particularly young black men. Inner-city gang and gang-prone youth have

      appropriate employment skills and work attitudes. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Spergeletal1991">Spergel</a>,

    <p>The situation in Mexico is no different. Youth gangs are forming there in response to economic deprivation and a number of other factors.
    &quot; ... there has been a growth in the number of urban gangs, gangs of
    young people who compensate the overcrowding in family housing, the loss of
    future prospects and the lack of employment and job opportunities, by taking
    over segments of the urban environment ...&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Gordon1997">Gordon</a>,

    <p>If you're familiar with Bloods and Crips then perhaps you have heard of
    the supposed competition between the two. One of the
    probation officers I visited erred in scheduling clients for office visits and
    mixed Bloods with Crips in the waiting room. &quot;All hell broke
    loose,&quot; she said. &quot;We had to call in
    security.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>But the situation is not the same in all communities. Bloods
    and Crips in some communities, like many other gangs, are more interested in profit
    than in gang
    pride. Millions of American's who use cocaine, crack cocaine, methamphetimines,
    marijuana, ecstasy, or heroine
    have fueled a large and profitable market for illicit drugs. The poor quality of life found in our inner cities, and the lack of
    legitimate business skills among the youthful population which resides there, have
    created an
    alternate economy where theft and fencing operations, prostitution,
    gambling, and the sale of illegal drugs proliferate.

    <p><a name="Merton"></a>Writing in the 1930's, Robert King Merton, a well respected and insightful sociologist,
    suggested that people who are
    discriminated against and denied access to the legitimate means of achieving
    our culturally legitimated goal of financial success may turn to illegitimate
    means for reaching that goal. <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Merton1938">Merton</a>,
    1938)</font>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>For Merton, and most Americans, the legitimate means for reaching the 
    goal of financial success are the acquisition
    of an education and hard work. In American society most people do go to school, complete their education,
    find a job, and seek promotions at work as a means of achieving the culturally approved goal of financial success.&nbsp;However, millions of Americans are denied access to a good education and
    meaningful job opportunities, racial and ethnic minorities being the most
    recognizable among them. Schools and businesses in the neighborhoods in which they live
    are struggling and can offer little in the way of hope for the future.</p>

    <p>Among other alternatives, Merton believed people who are discriminated against may choose to
    use illegitimate means for reaching the goal of financial success. Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin
    <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#ClowardOhlin1960">1960</a>)</font>
    refined this concept. They added the notion that some of the illegitimate means may be
    as structured as the legitimate means - they called them <i> illegitimate
    opportunity structures</i> and gangs are one of them.&nbsp;</p>

    <p> Gangs provide a structure
    for earning money and obtaining other goods and services. Just like someone may apply for a
    legitimate job in order to make a living, someone else may be initiated into a gang which will also offer
    opportunities to make money. Gangs are an opportunity structure just like
    any legitimate business opportunity except that what they do is
    illegitimate.</p>

    <p>Small and Newman (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SmallNewman2001">2001</a>)
    believe &quot;neighborhoods mold those who grow up in them into certain
    behavioral patterns.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SmallNewman2001">Small
      and Newman</a>, 2001, p. 33) </font>In a similar fashion, Merton, Cloward, and Ohlin believed the social structure which human
    societies create can differentially impact the residents of that society.
    Those who are not discriminated behave one way (legitimately) and those who
    are discriminated against may behave in nonconforming ways.</p>

    provide a useful and concise look at the transition
    which has occurred in the American economy relative to gangs and the inner
    city. Where jobs in legitimate business are lost, activity in illegal
    activity may increase.

    <p align="left">Forced out of the legitimate marketplace, youth who form or 
    join gangs resort to earning income through illegal means. In addition to generating
    income through prostitution, counterfeit charge cards, extortion,  theft, and 
    other crimes, some gangs or
    gang members manufacture, cultivate, distribute and sell controlled substances. In fact, much ado has
    been made about gangs and drugs and, for the most part, it has been over exaggerated.
    According to Miller <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">2001</a>)</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The most common explanation for the increase in youth gang
      problems, and one particularly favored by law enforcement personnel,
      centers on the growth of the drug trade. Historically, youth gangs have
      engaged in a variety of illegal income-producing activities, including
      extortion, robbery, and larceny. In the 1980's, according to this
      argument, the increasing availability and widening market for illegal
      drugs, particularly crack cocaine, provided new sources of income.&nbsp;</b></font>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The relative ease with which large sums of money could be obtained by
      drug trafficking provided a solid financial underpinning for gangs,
      increased the solidarity of existing gangs, and offered strong incentives
      for the development of new ones. As gangs fought one another over control
      of the drug trade in local areas, the level of inter-gang violence rose
      and, in the process, increased gang cohesion and incentives to form
      alliances with other gangs.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>These developments, along with market requirements, resulted in
      widespread networks of drug-dealing gangs. The clear model here is that of
      organized crime during Prohibition, with rival mobs fighting over markets
      and forming alliances and rivalries with other mobs.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>This argument appears to have considerable power in accounting for the
      growth of drug gangs, and there is little doubt that the drug trade was
      one important factor in that growth. However, research studies on gangs
      and drugs have produced considerable evidence that the number of gangs
      directly involved in the drug trade is much smaller than claimed by the proponents
      of this position, that many gangs are involved only minimally with drugs,
      and that the development of cross-locality alliances and centralized
      control is mush less in evidence than has been claimed. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>,

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">In Closing</font></b>
    </p>

    <p>The inner-city environment in many gang cities in the United States may
    be characterized as having little in the way of economic opportunity for
    many of its youth, particularly poorly educated, immigrant, and minority youth. In the face of this, gangs may form as a mechanism for earning money or
    otherwise obtaining goods and services not available through legitimate
    means.
    </p>

    <p>But economic need alone is insufficient as an explanation for the
    formation of gangs. School failure must also be considered.
