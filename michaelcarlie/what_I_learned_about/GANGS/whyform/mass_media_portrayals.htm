    <p>Gangs migrate
    into the minds and lives of young people through the mass media. The term &quot;Mass media&quot; refers here to the Internet, radio,
    television, commercial motion pictures, videos, CDs, and the press
    (newspapers, journals, and magazines) - what are referred to collectively as
    broadcast and print media. Their impact on the minds of our youth has been
    hotly debated. I believe media portrayals
    which glorify gang behavior do little to help reduce our youth's interest
    in gangs.</p>
    <p>You may recall our discussion of the role <a href="../../gangs/whyform/economic_deprivation.htm"> economic deprivation</a> plays in
    the formation of gangs. The point of that discussion was that, being
    economically deprived, some youth will venture into illegal ways of earn an
    income. Movies and videos which show gang members enjoying
    the fruits of their illegal activities (i.e., drugs, sex, a nice apartment
    or house, money, cars, power, guns) suggest, in some children's minds, ways
    to reach the goal to which most American's aspire - financial
    success and all it entails.&nbsp;The ways in which that income is earned
    often entails the use of violence.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Before the age of eighteen, the average American teen
      will have witnessed eighteen thousand simulated murders on TV. While
      staggering in number, more disturbing is the effect this steady diet of
      imaginary violence may have on America's youth.</font></b>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Over the past forty years, more than three thousand
      studies have investigated the connection between television violence and
      real violence ... Though none conclude a direct
      cause and effect relationship, it becomes clear that watching television
      is one of a number of important factors affecting aggressive behavior. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Fanning1995">Fanning</a>,

    <p>By watching mass media portrayals of gang member behavior, some children learn 
    of illegitimate ways  to acquire goods and services. They learn how to lay in wait
    to &quot;hit&quot; (execute) someone. They learn what a drive-by-shooting
    looks like - how it's done and how to possibly get away without getting caught. If they watched <i>American History X</i>, they learned how to
    &quot;curb&quot; someone.</p>
    <p><a name="OpposingSkinHeadEmail"></a>If you didn't see <i>American History X</i>, here's what it shows - in full color and in
    all its gory detail. A Skinhead (a Caucasian gang known for its
    ideologically-based hatred of African-Americans and other minorities) is shown forcing an African-American youth
    to lay face-down in the street perpendicular to the curb. The youth's mouth
    is then forced open and pushed down until the curb is in his mouth. The
    skinhead then stomped on back of the young man's neck, fracturing his jaw,
    shattering his teeth, and breaking his neck. <font size="2">(<a href="OpposingSkinheadEmail.htm">Read 
	an opposing point of view.</a>)</font></p>
    <p>I mentioned earlier that the impact of the media on the minds of our youth is
    hotly debated. The debate goes like this ...</p>
    <p>There are those who believe only children who are predisposed to violence will be
    stimulated by it when shown in the media. Some believe otherwise
    non-violent children learn to be violent by watching violence, particularly
    when it is observed without the supervision of someone who explains that
    certain kinds of violence are inappropriate and wrong. Finally, there are
    those who believe violence in the media releases one's feelings of anger and
    violence by providing catharsis (in this case, a purging of one's own anger).</p>
    <p>Which is right? I think they all are. I believe there are children who
    are raised in violence and who, when they observe violence or other gang
    activity in the media , view the media portrayal as confirmation of what
    they already know. If you have a problem just put your fist in it and it
    will go away.</p>
    <p>I also believe there are unsupervised children who, fed a constant diet
    of television and rap music violence, begin to emulate it, particularly if
    there are others who are doing the same thing. Every child wants to be
    accepted. If I am rejected by the &quot;good kids,&quot; perhaps the
    &quot;bad kids&quot; will want me if I act and think like they do. And there
    are those who feel frustration and anger who, after a media portrayal of
    violence, feel purged of such feelings.</p>
    <p>When I read about the relationship between violence in the media and
    violence among our youth I extrapolate the findings and think of them in
    regard to gangs. When it comes to the portrayal of gangs and gang members, the
    mass media sometimes go into great detail. They portray the language, dress, body movements, and look of a gang
    member - male and female. They show, in explicit detail, the crimes
    gang members commit - how drugs are sold, how to &quot; shoot up&quot;
    (inject drugs intravenously), how to free base,
    how to rape someone, how to stab or shoot someone, how to settle disputes
    using violence. The list is very long. The problem is that it is the wrong
    list in terms of socializing our youth into acceptable, legal behaviors.</p>
    <p>The impact of media portrayals of gangs and the activities of their 
	members help us understand why gangs form, but sometimes gangs form by 
	following in the footsteps of others.</p>
