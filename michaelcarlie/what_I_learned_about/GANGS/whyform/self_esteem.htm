  <p>The development of low self-esteem in a child may be the result of detrimental experiences at <a href="../../gangs/whyform/school_failure.htm">school</a>, encounters
  in an abusive <a href="../../gangs/whyform/family.htm">home</a>, or as a result of negative
  experiences with peers. That's why I felt a separate section on self-esteem
  was needed.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>While some gang members present themselves with some bravado, think highly
  of themselves and proud of what they have become, some youth who join gangs suffer from a negative self image. Opportunities to feel good about themselves in their family or at school
  were few and far between. Yablonsky tells us &quot;The gangsters'
    personality problems of low self-esteem and sense of alienation drive them
    to act super tough to compensate for their sense of inferiority.&quot;<font size="1">
    (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Yablonsky1997">Yablonsky</a>,
    1997, p. 18)&nbsp;</font> Perhaps that's where some of that bravado comes
  from.</p>

    <p>According to Yablonsky,</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">...the following sequence of events depicts the
      early socialization process in the background of the typical sociopathic
      gangster: 1) as a child he is emotionally, sexually, or physically abused
      or neglected by his primary socializing agent, his parents. 2) Because he
      is treated in negative ways and with limited respect, the child feels
      humiliated, demeaned, and unworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>

      <p><font size="2"><b>3) As a consequence of this pattern of socialization
      he develops a low self-concept and feels self and other rage and
      hatred. He tends to accept on some deeper emotional level a message
      he is repeatedly given, which he interprets as &quot;If these powerful people
      in my life, my parents, think that I am stupid, inadequate, and unworthy
      of love and respect, I must be an inferior person.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>

      <p><b><font size="2">4) Mixed in with this creation of feelings of low
      self-esteem is a rage against the parents who abused or neglected him, and
      this rage is often displaced to others in a society that also treats them
      with a level of disrespect. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Yablonsky1997">Yablonsky</a>,
      1997, pp. 120-121)</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Children who have acquired a negative self-concept and low self-esteem in
  their formative years then go to school and have the potential of eliciting
  similar negative responses from teachers and peers. It is, in many cases, a
  self-fulfilling prophecy. It were as though the child were saying &quot;Everyone at home relates to me as a bad person. So, I must be a
  bad person.&quot; When the child starts going to school he acts like a bad
  person and school officials and peers begin to deal with him or her as a bad
  person. &quot;See,&quot; the child says, &quot;I told you I must be a bad
  person. They even treat me that way at school!&quot;</p>

    <p>Middle- and upper-class youths have several sources for achieving a
    sense of self worth and esteem. Among them are excelling at school,
    succeeding in extracurricular athletics, going to camp and excelling in a
    leisure-time activity or craft, and earning a legitimate part-time
    income. Some of these avenues are unavailable to lower-class children and
    even less so to children from the <a href="../../../Resources/glossary.htm#Underclass">underclass</a>.</p>

  <p>Youths who are effectively abandoned by parents and school may seek
  one another out or meet as a result of their misbehavior. As Maslow noted,
  we all have a basic need for acceptance and belonging. These children have
  the same need - perhaps more so due to their other basic needs going unmet. As they
  socialize, will a group develop? If they socialize with one another over time
  and support one another in violating the law, a gang has been formed.</p>

  <p>As in non-gang society, gangs offer many ways in which their members may
    earn respect. Succeeding in the commission of a crime earns
    respect. Respect may be earned by ripping people off, disrespecting
    authority, dominating another person, exploiting others, serving time in
    prison, and being a known associate of a gang member with greater status
    than one's own. The point here is that a gang provides these opportunities
  -&nbsp; opportunities which the gang member perceived of as unavailable outside the
    gang.</p>

  <blockquote>

  <p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>Despite similarities to
  boys in their behavioral activities and in reasons for joining gangs, girls
  reported greater social isolation from family and friends. Girls also reported
  lower levels of self-esteem. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Esbensenetal1999">Esbensen
  et al</a>., 1999)</font></p>

  </blockquote>

    <p>A lack of self-esteem alone, however, is insufficient as an explanation for the
    formation of gangs. The absence of a rite of passage from childhood to
    adulthood may also add to their development.</p>
