    <p>While reading about why gangs form it is important to remember two
    things. First, as defined in this book, a gang is a group of two or more individuals who have an
    on-going relationship with each other and support one another individually or collectively in
    the recurring commission of delinquent and/or criminal behavior.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Second, as we learned in <a href="../../gangs/structure_of_gangs.htm"><i>The
    Structure of Gangs</i></a>, gangs vary widely in their make up. They may
    consist of as few as two people who exhibit little organization in the gang
    and commit minor delinquent acts or crimes to highly organized crime gangs 
    (organized crime, crime networks, etc.)
    involving scores of members involved in sophisticated international crime.
    </p>

    <p>Even minor violations of law are still violations of the law. Truancy
    (unexcused or inexcusable absences from school as a minor) is an example.
    That's why I believe two boys who have an on-going relationship and who support
    one another in continually being truant have the potential for becoming a gang.
    </p>

    <blockquote>

    <p><font size="2"><b>Gangs are a conscious product of young people
    organizing their lives on the streets. They usually begin as unsupervised
    male or female peer groups within defined urban spaces. Some, but not all,
    evolve into formal organizations with social, economic, or political
    functions, and have older members. Gangs also organize within certain
    institutions, such as prisons and the military, with variable ties to
    outside street gangs or organizations. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#ClarkCenter">Kenneth

    <p>Two friends playing hooky may not fit the image most people have of a gang, but
    they have the potential of forming one. Left alone, the behavior of the two boys may turn to
    other violations of law (i.e., loitering, disturbing the peace, being a
    public nuisance, theft, experimenting with drugs) and, were it to do so,
    more people would see them as a gang.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <blockquote>

    <p><b><font size="2">We define group delinquency as law-violating behavior
    committed by juveniles in relatively small peer groups that tend to be
    ephemeral, i.e., loosely organized with shifting leadership. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#CurrySpergel1988">Curry

    <p>Perhaps Curry and Spergel <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#CurrySpergel1988">1997</a>)
    </font>would not define two associating truants as a gang, but I think we should be
    concerned about them. It's all a matter of degree, and the
    sooner we recognize what it is that is <i> potentially</i> developing, the more
    likely we are to &quot;nip the problem in the bud,&quot; to use an old
    expression.&nbsp;If the two boys are willing to violate the law and be
    truant, and they
    know what they're doing is illegal, they have an incorrect mind set. They
    need attention and supervision. They need help. Without it, things could get
    worse.

    <p>Why do gangs form? That may be the single most important question to ask concerning the
    gang phenomenon. The answer to it reveals why some youths join gangs
    and, correspondingly, the needs gangs fulfill for youths which are going unmet.
    </p>

    <p>The situation in the United States is repeated in other cultures, as I
    witnessed when studying the gang situation in Canada, England, and the
    Netherlands. Nearly everyone I interviewed identified the causes of gang
    formation within a relatively narrow range of possibilities.
    They believed unmet needs drove many youths to join gangs, as did greed and
    fear.

    <p>According to Maslow, as each lower need is satisfied, the
    next level becomes dominant with self-actualization being the ultimate goal.
    Where a need is absent, movement to
    the next level is impeded. From this point of view, lacking a sense of <i> security</i>
    (a lower level need) at home or in school, a youth may join with similarly situated youths
    who provide the needed security. Absent a sense of <i> belonging</i> (a
    higher level need) at home or at school, a youth may
    join with similarly situated youths for
    mutual support, acceptance, and friendship. The same situation
    may develop in order to satisfy the other higher level needs.&nbsp;</p>

            an alternative middle school why some youths get involved in gangs.
            &quot;Where we're going wrong is that the family is not meeting
            their needs,&quot; she replied, &quot;so they go to the gang where they can get them.
            Things like being
accepted and getting support - good times or bad. Families should be
a place where a child can get unconditional love, set goals and parameters of
behavior, be protected. I don't think the kids in gangs are getting those
things from their families. These kids have not experienced success
- and neither have their parents.<br>
<br>
            &quot;We [the community] don't support our families. At the
same time, the families need to be self supported - they should not depend on welfare programs and the government.
            We've given them the wheat
instead of showing them how to grow it. Do you know what I mean? Lots of families have been allowed to be weak, that's what I mean.
            And there don't seem to be any family traditions for these kids. Like
            'In our family we do this, or we celebrate
that, or we believe this is right or that is wrong.' That seems to
be missing.<br>
<br>
            &quot;We need to teach them process, not just give them food, housing and jobs. Instead
of using a bus to pick up kids and bring them to school, we should use a cattle
prod to poke the kids' parents to get them to bring their kids to school. Actually, I think the problem has gone on too long.
            We
should forget about the parents and just focus on the kids. It's too late
for the parents.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>

    <p> One might ask, How
    do such similarly situated children meet each other? Children who are abused at home or who are tormented at school may,
    because of their behavior, be singled out by school officials for special treatment.
    Placing these children in special classes, tracks, or programs puts them together.</p>

    <p>If the behavior these at-risk youths exhibit leads to
    police custody, they are likely to meet in detention centers. Upon release
    these youths are sometimes shunned and, intentionally or not, placed in a situation
    where their only friends may be others who have misbehaved. The beginnings of a gang are not difficult to see in
    these scenarios. A lack of security or sense of belonging at home, however, is not the only reason why gangs
    form.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000" size="2">&quot;The gang is an important social institution for low-income male
    youths and young adults from newcomer and residual populations because it

    et al.</a>, 1991, preface)</font><font size="2"> </font>
    </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Why gangs form and why some youths join them are two different questions,
    but their answers are inextricably intertwined. If you read the professional
    literature on gangs you will find the topic &quot;Why youths join gangs&quot;
    discussed far more often than &quot;Why do gangs form?&quot;&nbsp;I prefer to write
    about why gangs <i>form</i>  because I believe removing those factors will
    more effectively reduce
    gang activity in the long run. It puts our focus on the forces which pull or push some
    youths into a gang rather than on the youths themselves.
    </p>

    <p>This perspective on why gangs form requires a paradigm shift for those who focus more on the gang
    members than on the reasons why the gang they joined was created in the
    first place. Using the analogy
    of the <a href="../../../Orientation/perspective.htm#Spigot">spigot and the
    spill</a>, I would rather turn off the spigot than spend an eternity trying to
    clean up a never ending spill.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Gangs
    are an adaptive social mechanism for satisfying the needs of some youth
    which are not, or can not be, met through
    traditional and socially acceptable avenues. Gangs form to satisfy
    needs which are going unmet in the families, schools, and neighborhoods in
    which they live or which are perceived of as unavailable to the youths who
    join
    them.
    Moore <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Moore1998">1998</a>)
	</font>encapsulates the multi-causal perspective on gangs when he suggests 
	that four community conditions often precede the transition from typical 
	adolescent groupings to established youth gangs.&nbsp; First, conventional 
	socializing agents, such as <i>families and schools</i>, are largely 
	ineffective and alienating.&nbsp; Under these conditions, conventional adult 
	supervision is largely absent.&nbsp; Second, the adolescents must have a great 
	deal of <i>free time</i> that is not consumed by other healthy social 
	development roles.&nbsp; Third, for the gang to become established, members must 
	have <i>limited access to appealing conventional career lines</i>; that is, 
	good adult jobs.&nbsp; Finally, the young people must have <i>a place to 
	congregate</i> – such a well-defined neighborhood.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000" size="2">&quot;Gangs are nothing more than a
perversion of what contemporary society is all about - money, power, sex,
consumption, status, leisure, amusement. People who have the

    </blockquote>

    <p>Some researchers have written about the <i>pushes</i> and <i> pulls</i> of
    gangs. <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Reckless">Reckless</a>
    being the among the first)</font>&nbsp; That is, there are factors which push youths into gangs
    and
    factors which pull them in. The <i> pushes</i> are listed in the chart
    below under &quot;Why Gangs Form.&quot; The <i> pulls</i> are listed under
    &quot;What Gangs Offer.&quot; For example, economic deprivation
    may push a youth into a gang because the gang offers an opportunity
    for economic gain which the youth could not or would not pursue
    legitimately. That's what is attractive about the gang and thus
    pulls the youth into it.

    <p><a name="multi-causal"></a>There is no one all-encompassing reason for the formation of
    gangs, although there may be some reasons which are more significant than others
    in their initial impact. The reasons why I believe gangs form, what they offer their members, and
    why some youths join them, are presented in the chart below.
    They seem obvious to me now after three years in the field and after reading
    the findings of many experts on gangs. At least three themes form the backdrop against which the causes of gang
    formation should be understood.

    <p>The following are the most apparent explanations for the formation of 
    gangs. The explanations are not mutually exclusive and 
    the exact mix of one or more explanations with other explanations may vary over time and from one neighborhood to another. There 
    are a few, however, which regularly appear in
    <a href="../where.htm#entrenchment">chronic gang communities</a>. Addressing 
    and removing them would have a major impact upon the gang phenomenon. There 
    are other explanations, not covered here, which suggest that the typical
    <a href="pathological.htm#Samenow">sociological and psychological 
    explanations are misleading</a>.<br>
