sell drugs in their territory - $40 a day per seller is typical. And they are a ruthless group of predators.
            They have tax collectors
            - gang members who collect the tariffs. Prostitutes conducting business on their turf also pay a

<p align="left">Prior to carrying out my research, the image I carried in my
mind about the structure of gangs may have mirrored that of many other Americans. They were either highly structured and
referred to as &quot;organized crime&quot; gangs (&quot;gangsters&quot; or
&quot;mobsters&quot;) or they were loose confederations of youths
who initiated new members then partied with each other and committed a wide
range of different crimes. The impression I had was created by the mass media, for the most
part, since I had limited exposure to gangs as a youth.</p>
<p align="left">As I was to discover, in real life gangs exhibit a wide range of attributes
along each of which there is considerable variation. The chart below illustrates
some of the more significant characteristics of gangs and how each varies on a continuum. The chart is
    useful for a variety of reasons. It suggests that the only thing which
differentiates &quot;<a href="whyform/because_they_can.htm#GroupDelinquency">group delinquency</a>&quot;<font size="1"> </font>or a very low-level street/youth gang from an organized crime gang is a matter of
degree of one characteristic or another along the continuum.</p>

        gang unit supervisor told me that &quot;Street gangs here are getting into
        organized crime including the manufacture and distribution of
        methamphetamine. And the same people are beginning to appear who are
        selling drugs as well as running prostitution in town.&quot;</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

<p>The chart also reflects the very real potential for street gangs to develop
    into more organized crime units or for certain members of
    street gangs to be recruited into more formally organized gangs. This suggests that the loosely
    organized, seemingly benign street gangs in one's community could mature
into a bigger problem tomorrow. Those who suggest street gangs don't develop
into organized crime gangs must believe the Sicilian Mafia was created instantly.

  <p><b><font size="2">Intelligence developed through investigations has
  revealed extensive interaction among individuals belonging to gangs across the
  Nation. This interaction does not take the conceptual form of traditional
  organized crime. It is more a loose network of contacts and associations that
  come together as needed to support individual business ventures.</font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>There are however, some street gangs that possess
  structured organization in their drug operations. In cities such as Chicago
  and New Haven, the Black Gangster Disciple Nation, Vice Lords, and Latin Kings
  have a more recognized organizational structure, funneling profits upward

	individuals who are culturally and criminally enmeshed in the gang and are 
	at risk of being so for life. Most violent gang activity emanates from the 
	hard core gang members. Hard core gang members usually make up about 10% of 
	gang membership.<br>
	3. Associate:<br>
	The associate gang member has usually made a personal commitment to the gang 
	culture and is dedicated to achieving the level of recognition needed to 
	attain hard core status.<br>
	<br>
	4. Fringe:<br>
	The fringe gang member is still able to function outside of the gang 
	structure and has not made a commitment to a life in the criminal gang 
	culture. This type of member drifts in and out of the gang and seems to lack 
	direction.<br>
	<br>
	5. Wanna-Bes:<br>
	Wanna-bes are not actually gang members. They are youth who view the gang as 
	an exciting place to be, a place where they could become &quot;somebody&quot;. 
	Wanna-bes may emulate gang dress, graffiti, hand signs, and other gang 
	cultural symbols, and they may associate with known gang members, but they 
	have not yet been excepted into the gang.<br>
	<br>
	Cliques:<br>
	Very seldom is the gang at full strength. Exceptions to this, of course, 
	would be times of conflict or possibly at social functions. What is most 
	often seen as &quot;the gang&quot; is usually a clique from within the larger gang. 
	The clique is a group of associate, fringe, and often, wanna-be gang members 
	who gravitate around one or more of the hard core gang members. This 
	somewhat resembles a gang within a gang. </font>

<p align="left">An important attribute of most groups is the assignment of
statuses and accompanying role expectations upon its members. We noted in our
previous discussion of <a href="../gangs/culture.htm#Status">gang culture</a> that there
is a distinction between a person's status and his or her roles. One's status is what one
<i>is</i>. I am a
university professor. That's one of my statuses in life. I am also a
an uncle and a musician. Those, too, are statuses.</p>
<p align="left">One's <i>roles</i> are those behaviors a person is expected
to exhibit <i> within</i> a given <i>status</i>. As a professor I am expected to teach,
conduct research, and provide service to my university, the profession, and the
community. Those are
some of roles which constitute my status as professor. As an uncle I am expected to be
supportive of my nephews and nieces and listen to their concerns. Those
are some of the roles attached to the status of uncle.</p>
<p align="left">Similarly, gang members have statuses and roles. While the
names for these statuses vary widely across gangs, they include <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Original">Original Gangster</a> 
(O.G.), Gangster (G.) or Young Gangster (Y.G.),
<a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Associates"> Associate</a> or Baby
Gangster (B.G.),
and <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Wannabe"> Wannabe</a> (W.B.). In a 
conversation <font size="1">(12 March 2005) </font>with Curtis Sliwa (creator of 
the Guardian Angels), he said &quot;There are three characters out there - predators, 
prospects, and posers. The predators are the most heavily involved gang members. 
Prospects are similar to associates in that they are involved and are getting 
themselves further involved in gang activity. Posers, on the other hand, don't 
want to have anything to do with gangs, but they &quot;get off on lookin' cool, like 
one of the gang, like MTV and BET. They're part of the youth culture, but not 
the gang culture.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">In more formalized gangs there are such statuses
as president, vice president, treasurer, secretary (often the keeper of the
scrapbook of newspaper articles about the gang), parliamentarian, and
sergeant-at-arms. In ethnic gangs the names for the various status
positions are different but the roles expectations are the same.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Most gangs have leaders. This should not be
  very surprising, as few organizations can survive without some form of
  leadership ... Not surprisingly, leadership roles are better defined in those
  gangs and gang cities where gangs have operated the longest. Thus, in Chicago
  and Los Angeles, we find gang leaders who are older, more specialized in their
  activities, and more powerful. In other cities, those we have called emerging
  gang cities, leadership roles have a far more informal character. In these
  gangs, the leader of a gang can change from one day or one function to another
  ... As gang membership entails much criminal activity, it is not surprising to
  find that leaders change regularly, as members go to prison. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#CurryDecker1998">Curry

        marijuana. Some may possess the skills needed to steal a vehicle in under 60
        seconds. Finally some may have the heart, or lack of conscience, to
        commit random acts of violence towards innocent people or rival gang
        members. Usually the selection of their moniker begins to solidify their

<p align="left">Several of the O.G.'s I interviewed considered themselves to be teachers in the gang. They taught the younger gang members how to
handle themselves in a variety of situations (i.e., in fights, during drug deals,
with police, the courts, while in jail or prison, how to commit certain crimes). One of
them told me he tells the wannabes in his gang that he wants them to
&quot;Walk across the stage&quot; - go to school and graduate.</p>

  considerable number of years as a member of their gangs are in a position to
  obtain rank and as a consequence are afforded special status and perform
  unique duties. Often referred to as OGs or original gangsters, these
  individuals hold the distinction of having lived through a number of years of
  gang life. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#CurryDecker1998">Curry

<p align="left"> Other statuses in a gang,
and some of the roles they include, are &quot;mule&quot; (someone who carries drugs from one place to
another), &quot;<a name="shot">shot</a> caller&quot; (the leader of a gang or a specific criminal
activity committed by a faction within the gang),
and &quot;look out&quot; (someone who keeps an eye on the vicinity in which a crime or
meeting is occurring to warn of the approach of rivals or police). Generically
speaking, there are also gang members who fulfill the role of drug or gun buyer,
supplier, seller/&quot;foot soldier,&quot; dealer, distributor, deal maker,
negotiator, guard, and <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Tagger" name="tagger"> tagger</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The point is this. If individual gang members have specific statuses and roles

<p align="left">Young people who want to be gangsters - usually called wannabes
- are among the most dangerous of all the gang
members. This observation was made by dozens of interview subjects
during the course of my three years of field research- including established gang members. The violence and reckless abandon
often exhibited by wannabes places them in a special category.
Their behavior may be even more unpredictable and hard core than the most
seasoned gang member's.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The word &quot;wannabe&quot; has been co-opted by mainstream American 
culture. For example, it's not unusual to hear beginning tennis players call 
themselves &quot;wannabe&quot; tennis players. This popularization of the term has removed 
much of the negative or potentially dangerous connotation from it. That's 
unfortunate. Wannabe gang members are, because of this popularization, sometimes 
not seen for the danger they present. They are not seen as gang members, hence some
communities take little action to deal with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The most effective way to keep youths from joining gangs is to
keep gangs from forming. &quot;Why gangs form&quot; is the topic of the next section.</p>
