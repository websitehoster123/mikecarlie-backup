  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Elusive, ephemeral, ever-changing, fluid - these are
    words that come to mind in describing youth gangs today. While some
    gangs in chronic gang cities are more stable, many gangs, regardless of
    where we find them, are fluid. Their fluidity is exhibited in several ways.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">1. Leadership:</font><font color="#800000"> </font></b>One
      gang member may lead an entire gang or there may be several different
      leaders, each with a small group of gang members following him or her in
      the commission of their criminal activity. For example, gang members
      who are into the drug trade may do their thing while other members of the same
      gang who are not into the drug trade go about committing the offenses they
      prefer to commit. Leadership may change due to leaders being arrested, incarcerated,
      injured, leaving town to avoid prosecution, or attempting to leave the
      gang.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">2. Gang Composition: </font></b>Not all gang members stay in the same gang for a long period of
      time. The composition of a gang may change as a result of the
      recruitment of new gang members and due to established members' moving out of
      town, quitting the gang, getting arrest, being incarcerated, injured, or dying.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">3. Size: </font></b>A gang may
      consist of five members one year, 30 the next, and disappear the following
      year.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">4. The Nature of Crimes
      Committed: </font></b> The nature of the criminal activities exhibited by
      gang members may change from time to time depending upon who is in the gang
      and what their interests are, the desires of its leaders,
      shifting opportunities for crime, and the nature of law enforcement 
		practices in the community.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">5. Migration:</font></b>  Some gang
      members migrate from one country to another, one community
      to another within the same nation, and within communities (from one
      neighborhood to another). </p>
		<p align="left">In 1999 it was reported that 34% of
      gang members in rural areas had migrated there, 27% of small city gang
      members were migrants, 20% of gang members in suburban counties were
      migrants, and 17% of large city gang members were migrants from other
      communities.<font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Egley2000">Egley</a>,

      <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>According to the 1999 National Youth 
      Gang Survey, 18 percent of all youth gang members had migrated from 
      another jurisdiction to the one in which they were residing. </b></font>

      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">International migration (from one country to another) is 
		foremost on the minds of anyone today who is concerned about the gang 
		phenomenon. The world of gangs now includes gang members from 
		practically as many nations as there are on Earth.&nbsp; The collapse of 
		the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the Berlin Wall resulted in 
		the spread of people of various nationalities throughout Western Europe, 
		the United States, and elsewhere.</p>
		<p align="left">Likewise, the movement of populations from the 
		underdeveloped, Third World nations into developed nations continues 
		unabated as does the movement of South- and Central American's into 
		North America. Given the reality of the immigration tradition, a small 
		portion of each of the migrating populations is likely to be found 
		participating in gang activity.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">6. Gang Affiliation:</font></b> A
      given individual may be a member of one gang one
      day and another gang the next. The gang member may even quit after only one or two
      years.&nbsp;</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Studies of established gangs in chronic
      gang cities since the 1920's have documented long delinquent gang careers.
      Recent studies in emerging gang problem cities, like Denver (Esbensen and
      Huizinga) and Rochester (Thornberry, et al.,1993) have found that most
      juveniles stay in the gang for no more than a year. Their delinquency
      levels were much lower both before and after joining the gang. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell1994">Howell</a>,

    	<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>7</b></font><b><font color="#0000FF">. 
		Relationships between Gangs:</font></b></p>
		<p>While most people believe that certain gangs never get along with 
		other gangs (i.e., Crips and Bloods are viewed as arch rivals), the fact 
		is that some gangs/sets don't get along with one another and others do. 
		Depending upon the local situation, previously-competing gangs may be 
		associating with one another, committing crimes side-by-side or 
		coalescing into one larger gang or set.</p>
		<p>This situation became obvious to me as I watched drug dealers selling 
		their drugs on a corner in Kansas City. On the same corner were young 
		men wearing red bandanas and other red clothing standing next to young 
		men wearing blue bandanas and other blue clothing. They were interested 
		in making money by selling drugs, not fighting or establishing dominance 
		over one another.</p>
		<p>In other neighborhoods and cities, the battle lines between certain 
		gangs is clear and inviolable. The only way to characterize their 
		relationship with one another is to say it is hostile and, at times, 
		deadly. </p>
		<p><b><font color="#0000FF">8. Location</font></b></p>
		<p>Gang turf can change, typically in reaction to pressure put on the 
		gang members by police. A neighborhood may be the locus of gang activity 
		one year and relatively free of gang activity the next year because the 
		gang activity moved to a different neighborhood. This phenomenon is so 
		common that it now has a name --- gang displacement. </p>
		<p>The location of a gang may also change as its members leave the gang, 
		get arrested and incarcerated, are injured, killed or move to a 
		different location. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Given the fluidity of the gang situation, it is difficult, if not
    impossible, to generalize about gangs. When it comes to
    addressing a specific community's gang situation, each
    community needs to study its own situation and steer clear of national or
    state-wide data. &quot;Know thyself&quot; is the rule when it comes to
    determining what must be done to reduce problems associated with the
    presence of gangs in one's community.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The Extent and Impact of Migrating
    Gang Members</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">During my research I had an opportunity to accompany
    officers dealing with Afro-Caribbean drug dealers on the south side of the
    Thames River in London, England. These gang members were, at one time,
    members of various Posses in their native Jamaica. The migration of the Jamaican drug gang members mirrors the migration of other gangs'
    members who move from one country to another in furtherance of their criminal
    activities.</p>
    <p align="left">More common in the United States, however, is the migration
    of gang members from one city to another or within the same
    city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>From a series of studies completed in the United states we've learned
    that
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Migrant gang members may stimulate the growth
      of gangs and gang membership through a variety of processes, such as
      recruiting locals to establish a branch of the gang in previously
      unaffected areas. This approach, described as the importation model,
      involves efforts by gang members to infuse their gang into new cities,
      primarily to establish new drug markets and other money-making criminal
      enterprises </font></b>
      <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#DeckerWinkle1996">Decker and Van
      Winkle</a>, 1996)</font><font size="2">.<b> This is also referred to as
      gang franchising</b>
      </font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knoxetal1996">Knox et
      al.</a>, 1996)</font><font size="2"><b> and gang colonization</b>

      Tobolowsky, and Downs</a>, 1994)</font><font size="2">.&nbsp; </font>
      <p><b><font size="2">Alternatively, migrants may establish a new gang
      without structural affiliation to an existing gang. Furthermore, if a
      sufficient number of individuals from a gang move to a new location, they
      may replicate a migrant subset of their former gang. No matter what
      process is used, new local gangs will most likely emerge in response to
      territorial challenges or perceived protection needs. Regardless of the pattern of new gang initiation, gang member migration
      would create an increase in both the number of gangs and gang membership.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Another way migrant gangs may stimulate gang
      proliferation is by introducing new and exciting cultural distinctions
      from existing gangs. In a city in which gangs exist but are not firmly
      established, migrant gang members may act as cultural carriers of the
      folkways, mythologies, and other trappings of more sophisticated urban
      gangs. They may offer strong distinctions from other gangs and cause a
      rivalry with existing gangs, such as the rivalry between the Bloods and
      Crips in southern California and between the People and Folks in the
      Midwest. In addition, the solidification of local gang subcultures may
      increase the visibility or attractiveness of gangs to local youth. It may
      also influence the growth of rival gangs.</font></b><font size="2"> </font>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Conversely, there are a variety of circumstances in
      which migrant gang members have little or no impact on gang proliferation.
      If the geographic location allows, migrants may retain their affiliation
      with their original gangs by commuting to old territories or they may
      simply discontinue gang activity altogether. In cities with relatively
      large and established gangs, it is unlikely that migrant gang members
      would have a noticeable effect on the overall gang environment. </b></font>
