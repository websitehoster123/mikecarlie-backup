    <p>Three years of wandering through gang-dominated neighborhoods introduced
    me to a wide diversity of people. A drive along <a name="Independence">Independence</a> Avenue in Kansas City,
    from the west side of the city to the east, took me progressively through a series of neighborhoods
    inhabited by Hispanics, African-Americans, Somalians, Russians, Asians, and back into another
    Hispanic neighborhood. Although divided by only a street (also the
    geographic dividing line between the states of Kansas and Missouri), the
    Hispanic gang youth in Kansas City, Kansas, don't get along with Hispanic
    gang youth on the Missouri side of the city, nor to the Asians get along

    <p>This situation is developing in communities across the United States and in other countries as
    well. The inability of people from different nations or races to
    accommodate each another in the same city or neighborhood sometimes leads to conflict. This is evident in gang neighborhoods
    where rental properties and
    transient populations abound. There is little stability in those
    neighborhoods and they are socially disorganized.
    <p>When I began my research
    on gangs I thought most gang members in the United States were
    African-Americans. That's what the mass media seemed
    to portray. But the reality of the streets was quite
    different. &quot;The 1998 National Youth Gang Survey revealed that Hispanics were
    the predominant racial/ethnic group among all gang members nationwide. As
    shown in Table 19 (below), Hispanics accounted for 46 percent of all gang
    members, followed by African Americans (34 percent), Caucasians (12
    percent), Asians (6 percent), and other races (2 percent).&quot; <font size="1">(<i><a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NationalYouthGangSurvey">1998

    <p>The proportion of gang members who are Hispanic has been steadily
    growing, as have the number of Hispanics living in the United States. The
    estimated number of Hispanics living in the United States increased from
    27,107,000 in 1995 to 32,832,000 in 2000 - an increase of approximately 20%
    in five years.<font size="1"> (U.S.
    Census Bureau, <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/nation/intfile3-1.txt">page</a>)&nbsp; </font>This increase, due primarily to immigration and a high birth rate among
    Hispanics, is now being felt beyond the sunbelt states as
    Hispanics move into communities throughout the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p> While the vast majority of Hispanics in the United States are hard-working and
    make important contributions to the communities in which they live, some disaffected Hispanic
    youth
    contribute to
    the growing Hispanic gang phenomenon.</p>
    <p>An ethnically diverse population immigrating into the United States
    results in a more ethnically diverse gang population. It has
    been that way since peoples of other lands first began immigrating to the United
    States. For example, in the late 1890's through the first decade of the 1900's,
    many people from Ireland and Italy immigrated to the United States. At that
    time, Irish and Italian street gangs were commonplace.</p>

    <p>Decades later we have other ethnic minorities immigrating here and, as is
    often the case, a small proportion of their members are represented in the gang population.
    If anything
    became clear to me over the past three years it was that the most recently
    arrived minority, unless supremely well suited to compete in American
    society (as are many of the Asians as exemplified by their emphasis on
    education and entrepreneurial skills), will likely
    find a portion of its youth disenfranchised ... and they may turn to
    gangs as a means of rebelling, finding a place for themselves, or for
    earning an income, among other things. This is referred to in
    the literature as the &quot;immigration gang tradition&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>,

    <p>While data on the racial and ethnic composition of gangs suggest
    they are predominantly Hispanic, African-American, and Caucasian, what's
    missing is a look inside those ethnic and racial groups.&nbsp;According to
    the <i>1998 National Youth Gang Survey</i><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NationalYouthGangSurvey">2000</a>)</font>,
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Respondents estimated that more than one-third
    (36 percent) of their youth gangs had a significant mixture of two or more
    racial/ethnic groups. The largest proportion of these mixed gangs was
    in small cities, where they represented 54 percent of all gangs, and the
    smallest proportion was in large cities (32 percent). The proportion of
    mixed gangs was larger in the Midwest than in any other region. </b></font>

    <p>Depending upon their roots, these populations may or may not associate
    with one another peaceably. Within the category of
    &quot;Hispanic,&quot; for example, are Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Rican,
    Ecuadorians, Dominicans, Colombians, Panamanians, and
    others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The situation is the same concerning African-Americans. Depending upon which African
    nation an individual comes from, his or her relations with others of
    African descent may vary. Antagonisms sometimes exist between West
    Indian blacks (&quot;Afro-Caribbeans,&quot; as they are sometimes called,
    who come from such places as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Trinidad,
    Barbados, and Haiti) and blacks from the African continent (i.e., Ghana, Somalia, Kenya, Senegal, and Nigeria, as well as between ethnically
    divergent tribes
    within those nations). Conflicts
    also arise between continental Africans.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p>Conflict and distrust within the Asian
    community also exists and may be observed at the gang level between Asians who are
    natives of the Philippines, Korea,
    Japan, Taiwan, China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India,
    and other Asian nations. Conflicts between all of these ethnicities
    (Hispanic, African, Asian) are sometimes ancient in origin and often fueled
    by current world events.<br>

    <p>One
    can see, therefore, ideological, political, cultural, and personal conflicts between
    gang youth from different nations, regardless of whether they are all
    Hispanic, African-American, or Asian. Their relationships with each
    other may sometimes be characterized as distrustful, disrespectful, and violent.
    The point here is that knowledge of the diversity which exists within larger ethnic
    categories helps us understand some gang behaviors and may guide efforts
    to reduce the most harmful of them.<p>Communities
    experiencing an influx of minorities and a simultaneous growth in gang
    activity are well advised to consider the need for developing ways to
    facilitate the integration of the minorities, particularly the minority youth.
    Increasing suppression efforts will
    likely worsen the
    situation for, once stigmatized by the justice system, problem youth
    will only be more difficult to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The Dutch approach seems enlightened.
    They have hired full-time social
    researchers whose only job is to learn more about problems surrounding the
    integration of minorities and to develop
    programs which may ease their entry into Dutch society. In the <i>Solutions</i>
    we will expand upon the implications of these findings in greater detail.<p>That concludes our
    look at the demographic profile of gang members in the United States. Our
    attention now turns to the fact that gang have been around for a long time,
    and not just in the United States.
