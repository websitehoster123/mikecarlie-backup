    <p> <a name="OnePercent"></a>Howell reported that &quot;Youth
    gang membership ... varies by locality. Surveys of urban youth
    samples indicate that from 14% to 30% of adolescents join gangs at some

    This is far higher than the often touted &quot;one per- centers&quot; that some 
    criminal justice practitioners talk about. They refer to gang members as the 
    &quot;one per centers&quot; in that they believe they represent only one percent of a 
    typical community's population or its minority/ethnic populations.</p>
<p> The newest data is from a report titled &quot;Highlights of the 2002 National 
Youth Gang<br>
Survey,&quot; written by Arlen Egley, Jr., and Aline K. Major, and published in April 
of 2004. The following are the major findings of that report.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><b><font size="2">Based on survey results, it is estimated that, in 2002, 
	youth gangs were active in more than 2,300 cities with a population of 2,500 
	or more and in more than 550 jurisdictions served by county law enforcement 
	agencies. These results are comparable to those from recent NYGC (National 
	Youth Gang Center) surveys and provide preliminary evidence that the overall 
	number of jurisdictions experiencing gang problems in a given year may be 
	stabilizing.<br>
	<br>
	It is also estimated that <font color="#0000FF">approximately 731,500 gang 
	members and 21,500 gangs were active in the United States in 2002</font>.
	<font color="#0000FF">The estimated number of gang members between 1996 and 
	2002 decreased 14 percent and the estimated number of jurisdictions 
	experiencing gang problems decreased 32 percent.</font> This difference is 
	largely a result of the decline in reported gang problems by smaller cities 
	and rural counties that have also reported comparatively fewer gang members 
	over survey years. Larger cities and&nbsp; suburban counties accounted for 
	approximately 85 percent of the estimated number of gang members in 2002.</font><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Egley2004">Highlights

    amorphous and difficult to count.&quot; <font size="1">
    (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">ibid</a>, p. 1)</font>
    In fact, the number of gang members reported depends upon a number of factors. What criteria are being used by local authorities to identify
    individuals who are members of a gang? That is, how are &quot;gang&quot;
    and &quot;gang member&quot; being defined? A change in the definition
    of a gang can radically alter the number of gangs identified.

        The rumor that this Mid-West town once had the highest concentration of
        gang members in the United States isn't true, according to three of the
        officers in the gang unit. They explained that, when the department
        scrambled to deal with the then new gang problem in the late 1980s,
        &quot;The original response was to deny that there was a </font></font><font size="2" color="#0000FF">problem. In
        time, the department had to
        acknowledge what everyone could now clearly see - there were gangs in
        our community.&quot;&nbsp;</font></b>
        <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF"> The department initiated a process of identifying
        who the gang members were and &quot;The criteria used to accomplish
        this were so broad that more people were included than perhaps should
        have been.</font></b><font size="2"> </font><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">Since that time the department has
        refined the criteria and, using this new definition, the number of
        documented gang members has been reduced. One of the most important
        changes was making a distinction between 'active' and 'inactive' gang
        members.&quot; An inactive gang member is someone with whom the
        police have had no interaction for two years.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">Later in the evening two of the
        officers explained that this is a somewhat problematic distinction
        since, during those two years &quot;the individual may simply
        not have been caught doing the illegal things they were doing, he may have been gang banging in
        another city or state, or</font></b><font size="2"> <font color="#0000FF"><b>he may have been in prison and
        could be gang banging there.&quot;</b></font></font></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">One officer expressed a concern
        that, due to the political flack unleashed by the presence of gangs,
        &quot;The new criteria being used were implemented to simply make it
        look like the problem was being reduced.&nbsp;It's all a matter of
        playing around with definitions and statistics ... the problem is still
        there, in other words. Back in the early '90s when they [<i>the public</i>] heard there were
        about 2,500 gang members in town we heard 'You have to get that number
        down!'&nbsp; Of course, one way to do that is to manipulate the criteria being
        used to define what a gang member is.&quot;</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

</div>

    <p>The number of gang members reported also depends upon whether local
    authorities choose to recognize a gang presence in their communities or not.
    Denial of a gang presence is not uncommon, therefore reports
    of &quot;no gang activity&quot; result in an
    inaccurate count of the number of gangs and gang members.
    </p>

    <p>While there are several ways to identify if someone is in a gang, not
    all gang members wear or otherwise exhibit gang identifiers (i.e., clothes of a
    certain color, tattoos). So, it's anyone's best
    guess as to exactly how many gangs and gang members there are in the United
    States - or in any country. The other countries included in this study (England, Canada,
and the Netherlands) are experiencing similar difficulties. The best guess is that
    the number of gang members in the United States has been increasing since
    the 1970s.&nbsp;<font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>,
    2001, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/ojjdprpt_yth_gng_prob_2001/chap1.html#f">page</a>)</font>
    </p>

    <p>As to the size of various gangs, they can range from just a few members 
    to hundreds. And their size varies over time. The largest gangs have been 
    reported to have thousands of members, but this is difficult to verify.</p>
