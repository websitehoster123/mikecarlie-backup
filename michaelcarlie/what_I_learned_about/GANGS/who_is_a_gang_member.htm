      have roots in the ephemeral drinking groups of young males in ceremonial
      settings. By the 1970s, gangs had transformed from informal groups to
      those coalesced around core members, who came from families that were
      marginal in the communities to which they returned after living off the
      reservation.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>Gang behaviors provide
      an extreme example of the behaviors (e.g., drinking, committing assaults)
      that generally contribute to the leading causes of mortality among young
      Navajo men. Although gang members constitute only a small minority of Navajo
      youths, since the 1970s gangs reputedly have become more common, more
      institutionalized, and more closely connected with non-Indian gangs off
      the reservation. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Henderson1999">Henderson</a>,

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Introduction</font></b></p>
    <p>All children are good children at birth. In time, life experiences result in their
    remaining good children or becoming children who behave badly. Some of
    them behave so badly they end up being imprisoned or executed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Any child can become a gang member. Gang members represent all social classes,
    both genders, and most ethnic or religious groups ... and they can be found in the most unexpected places. One community I
    visited had a gang of Mormon youth named after the ward in which they lived.
    Some gang
    members attend and graduate from college. In one college with a predominantly white student body, a group of
    African-Americans on the football team was found to be a gang selling crack
    cocaine in the neighborhood surrounding the university.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="center"><b><font size="2" color="#008000">[I]t is very 
		important to be mindful that the overwhelming majority of youth gangs 
		are “homegrown.&quot;&nbsp; They grow in the cracks of our society and local 
		communities, where social instructions such as families and schools are 
		ineffective, and social controls on young people and adults are weak.

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Being Identified as a Gang Member</font></b></p>
    <p> People associating with documented gang members sometimes become gang-members-by-association
    because they are viewed as gang members
    by police and other social service workers. It's
    from the word &quot;association&quot; that they have been given the name
    &quot;associates&quot; in the lexicon of law enforcement and gang research.
    </p>

    <p>In time, these associates may become gang members through a process
    referred to as labeling. The process involves the application of the label
    &quot;gang member&quot; to
    the associating youth by police, teachers, and others, and the eventual acceptance of
    that label by the youth in question. Even if the associate doesn't accept the label, the labelers
    continue to apply it and respond to
the individual as a gang member rather than as a non-gang member. It is a
self-fulfilling prophecy as one progresses from being identified as someone who was
    found with a known gang member, to becoming an associate, to
    becoming a documented gang member.

    <p>At the end of the day, anyone could be a gang member. Studies of known or
    suspected gang members suggest some people are more likely to be in a
    gang than others due to other characteristics they possess.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>At-Risk Youth</b></font></p>
    <p>I've heard many people say &quot;<i>All</i> kids are at-risk.&quot; After
    observing the gang scene for a few years it became apparent that they were
    right. All children are at risk of failing at school, getting involved in
    delinquency, becoming a member of a gang, becoming unemployable, and a myriad
    of other things.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Among the definitions for &quot;at-risk&quot; I have encountered are a school definition and a mental health definition.
    The school-based definition of an at-risk youth is a youth who is not likely
    to complete school or will finish well below his or her potential. The mental health definition of
    an at-risk youth is a youth who
    engages in activities that can have detrimental health consequences for the
    individual. Included among these risk factors are smoking, drinking
    alcohol, use of illegal drugs, carrying a weapon, and gang membership.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Generally speaking,
    at-risk youths may also exhibit such risk factors as teenage pregnancy, poverty, disaffection with school and
    family, disability (emotional, physical, mental), emotional and physical
    abuse, neglect, and their families may be highly mobile.&nbsp;Individuals who become gang members may be defined under either or both
    definitions since some exhibit multiple risk factors. We'll return to look
    at <a href="../../SOLUTIONS/ISSUE/risk_protective.htm">risk- and protective-factors</a> later in the book when we explore ways to
    reduce gang activity and youth violence.</p>
    <p>Gang members may also be characterized by various demographic
    characteristics including their number, age, social class, gender, race, and
    ethnicity. These are the demographic characteristics we're going to
    investigate next.&nbsp;</p>
