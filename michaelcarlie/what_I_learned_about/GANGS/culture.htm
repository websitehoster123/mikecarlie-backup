    <p>As we consider the culture of a gang we should first have an
    understanding of what a society and culture are. Societies consist of a <b><font color="#0000FF">group</font></b> of people who
    share an <b><font color="#0000FF"> exclusive territory</font></b> and
    a common <font color="#0000FF"><b>culture</b></font>.<a name="definition"></a>
    A culture &quot;is the totality of learned, socially transmitted customs, knowledge,
    material objects, and behavior.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Schaefer2001">Schaefer</a>,
    2001, p. 65)</font> Among the customs are <b><font color="#0000FF">norms</font></b>
    - expectations about how people in the society should behave.</p>
    <p>Most members of a society share a
    common <b> <font color="#0000FF">language</font></b>, <b><font color="#0000FF">beliefs</font></b>,<font color="#990033">
    </font> <b><font color="#0000FF">values</font></b>,<font color="#990033"> </font> <b> <font color="#0000FF"> symbols</font>,</b> and
    <b> <font color="#0000FF">artifacts</font></b>. Another important
    characteristic of societies is their tendency to organize into <b><font color="#0000FF"><a href="../../Orientation/perspective.htm#Institutional">social
    institutions</a></font>. </b>Among the most common are the family, faith organizations, schools,
    government, commerce, a military, justice system, and the like.</p>
    <p>The social institutions are further characterized by their internal
    organization whereby members hold specific statuses (what someone <i>is</i>)
    and are expected to fulfill
    the roles (what someone <i>does</i> in a given status) attached to each. For
    example, fathers are expected to provide guidance for their children and
    earn an income (two of a father's many roles). Children (a status) are
    expected to follow orders and eat everything on their plate (two of their
    many roles). Statuses are further differentiated in
    that one may have more power than another. For example, children (a status)
    are subordinate to fathers and mothers (statuses).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All of these - a society's culture, norms, language, beliefs, values, and symbols
    - are conveyed from generation to generation through a process called <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Socialization">socialization</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Why This is <a name="Important"> Important</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Understanding the nature of human society and culture is important because it helps us better understand gangs and the behavior of their
    members. Gangs are a part of our society and have become a
    mini-society of their own within it. This mini-society, referred
    to as a <i>subculture</i>, is part of the larger society in which we live.
    Some examples of the thousands of other subcultures in American society are the deaf,
    doctors, students, the Amish, and Hispanics.</p>
    <p>A subculture &quot;is a segment of society that shares a distinctive pattern
    of ... [norms] ... and values that differs from the pattern of the larger society.
    In a sense, a subculture can be thought of as a culture existing within a
    larger, dominant culture.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Schaefer2001">Schaefer</a>,
    2001, p. 78)&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p>What follows is a revision of some of the material you read above in <i><a href="../gangs/culture.htm#society">Gangs
    are a Society Within Society</a></i>  but with the word <i>gang</i> substituting for <i>society</i>.
    I'm doing this in hopes of highlighting the relevance of this discussion to 
    an understanding of gangs.</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The <a name="Sociological"> Sociological</a> Characteristics
    of a Gang</font></b></p>

    <p>G<i>angs</i> are <b><font color="#0000FF">groups</font></b> of people who
    often have an <b><font color="#0000FF"> exclusive territory</font></b> and
    exhibit a common <font color="#0000FF"><b>culture</b></font>. To the extent
    that gangs are recognized as groups: gang members recognize themselves as members,
    fellow gang members recognize
    them as members, and gang members - as well as non-gang members - outside a
    gang recognize who members of other gangs are. This recognition is key to
    identifying an aggregate of people as a group.</p>
    <p>Understanding that a gang may be viewed as a mini-society or subculture
    allows us to appreciate the importance some gangs place on their<b> <font color="#0000FF">territorial
                boundaries</font></b>. While for some the boundaries are defined
    as turf (i.e., a street corner, city park, neighborhood), for others the
    boundary is a market (i.e., customers who want a certain drug or service
    provided). The invasion of a gang's territory takes on new meaning when we
    understand their territory is as sacred to them as the land occupied
    by the United States is sacred to its citizens.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">With heavy doses of drugs often mixed into gang life,
      turf wars have become drug territorial wars. Turf, in some cases, means
      more than the place where the gang congregates. &quot;Gangs defend their
      territories in order to protect their narcotic business,&quot; ...
      &quot;Each street corner, dope house, salesperson, distributor, or
      customer is part of the territory.&quot; </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Gardner1992">Gardner</a>,
      1992, p. 41)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Each gang has a <font color="#0000FF"><b>culture</b></font>  of its own,
    although it may not be very different from the culture of other gangs. Using <a href="../gangs/culture.htm#definition">Schaeffer's
                definition</a>  of culture, gang members teach one another -
    formally and informally - what the customs of the gang are (i.e., how to
    dress, how to behave with women - or men), and they
    possess specific knowledge about the gang (i.e., traditions, initiation
    rites, territory, history).
    The culture of a gang is imparted from one generation to the next through a
    process called socialization.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>As indicated in our characterization of a society, <b><font color="#0000FF">norms</font></b> are
    behavioral expectations. The norms of a gang define
    which behaviors are expected and accepted among its members. Violations of the norms, depending upon their level of importance to members
    of the gang, may result in punishments which range from minor to
    severe. Understanding this allows us to understand gangs more fully and provides
    insights into the response of gang members to violations of their norms. For
    example, you may know that disrespecting (<i>slang: </i>dissing) a gang
    member may result in severe punishment for the person doing the
    disrespecting. Respect is a cherished value, so disrespecting a gang or gang
    member violates a cherished norm.</p>
    <p><a name="argot"></a>Similarly, members of a gang often share a
    common <b> <font color="#0000FF">language</font></b>, <b><font color="#0000FF">beliefs</font></b>,<font color="#990033">
    </font> <b><font color="#0000FF">values</font></b>,<font color="#990033"> </font> <b> <font color="#0000FF"> symbols</font>,</b> and
    <b> <font color="#0000FF">artifacts</font></b>. Every society has a common <b><font color="#0000FF">language</font></b>,
    both verbal and non-verbal. Gangs, too, have a language of their own. Nearly
    every group develops its own <b><font color="#0000FF"> argot</font></b> - its own special language. Doctors have
    one, lawyers have one, mothers have one, baseball players have one. Gangs
    also have an argot of their own.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Though killing each other over brands of sneakers,
      letters of the alphabet, and colors of clothing seems unbelievable, it is
      an extension of the gang member's whole existence revolving around the
      gang identity. If the gang stands for a person's whole sense of self, then
      everything he has, wears, or says is colored by gang identity. Thus, from
      the gang member's distorted viewpoint, any insult to even the trappings of
      gang identity is ground for battle. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Gardner1992">Gardner</a>,
      1992, p. 54)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Graffiti and throwing signs are forms of argot used within and between
    gangs. So are certain words gang members use, each often unique to the gang
    of which they are a member. Understanding <i>how</i>  gang members communicate allows us to
    understand <i>what</i>  they are communicating. For example, if a gang
    member's name/moniker is painted on a wall and is later crossed out, the
    person whose name was crossed out may be in danger from another gang.
    Likewise, if the number
                <i>187</i>  is used it may be communicating information about a
    murder or intended murder (the number &quot;187&quot; is the California
    state penal code number for murder).</p>

    nearly fifty years. As early as 1958, Walter
    Miller <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Miller1958">1958</a>)</font>, a well-respected
    American criminologist, was writing about this phenomenon.
    </p>

    <p>Miller believed &quot;The lower class has a separate, identifiable
    culture distinct from the culture of the middle class.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#VoldBernard1986">Vold
    and Bernard</a>, 1986, p. 214)</font> &quot;Where the middle class has
    'values' such as achievement, the lower class has 'focal concerns' that
    include

    <p>Miller described this lower-class culture as a 'generating milieu' for gang
    delinquency.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#VoldBernard1986">ibid</a>, p.
    214)</font>. His characterization of focal concerns may also partially
    explain lower-class youths' behavior in defiance of the middle class, its
    laws, authority figures, and
    their tendency to be careless and aggressive (at least in the eyes of the
    middle class).
    </p>

    <p align="center"> <b><font color="#800000"><a name="Status">Status</a> and Role Expectations</font></b></p>
    <p> Another important
    characteristic of a gang is their tendency to organize. Although the degree
    of organization may vary from one gang to another, each member typically has
    a certain <b><font color="#0000FF"> status</font></b> in the gang (i.e., leader, look out, dealer, 
	<a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Original">O.G.</a>) and
    is obligated to fulfill
    the <b><font color="#0000FF"> role expectations</font></b> attached to each status. Their statuses are further differentiated in
    that one status may have more power than another. For example, a newly
    initiated gang member (a
    status) is subordinate to older members and leaders in the gang (other
    statuses).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Each status position in the gang has a unique set of role expectations. An
    O.G. is usually expected to provide advice, maintain harmony within the
    gang, and provide for the protection of its members. A newly initiated gang
    member is expected to obey the O.G., commit crimes for the gang, and do
    whatever else he or she is told to do by those with greater status in the
    gang.</p>

                    organized, he defined some of the roles found in his, and
                    other, gangs he knew about. He identified and

                    members, acts as a look out for police. He said there
                    will likely be several look outs posted around the area who
                    also look for rival gang members who may upset the drug
                    deal. Look outs may often be found riding on bicycles around
                    the periphery of where the drugs are being sold.<br>

                    what he is told to do by someone with more status in the gang. &quot;Go kill so and so, go get this, get rid of
                    that ... stuff like that,&quot; he said. They
                    have little power in the gang but carry out some of the gang's
                    business. Charles describes flunkies as
                    having &quot;no feelings. Or, if they do, they hold 'em
                    in. They're cold hearted. They don't care about

                    Charles also said &quot;Gang members sometimes
                    switch gangs ... they're Bloods one week and Crips the next.
                    Or you'll find a guy in red next to a guy in

                    dedicated to the gang, otherwise they would not work
                    together like that]. Some guys take the gang thing as a game, just a phase in
                    their life. For others, it <i>is</i> their life.&quot;

                    fleeing prosecution in L.A., moved into other
                    communities. Local gang members were drawn to them
                    and, depending upon whether the L.A. gang member was a Crip
                    or a Blood, a new Crip or Blood gang was formed.

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Violence">Violence</a> as a Characteristic of Gang Culture</font></b></p>
    <p>The culture of the gang is often a culture of violence.
    It is a culture of physical
    assaults, guns, knives, bats, and anything that one can use to protect him-
    or herself or gain advantage over another person or situation. Gang members
    are less inhibited about using violence than non-gang members and confer status upon
    winners of violent confrontations.
    Given the setting in which many of the gang members I
    observed live, I am not surprised there is a great deal of violence.</p>
    <p>Frustration resulting from a lack of opportunity for meaningful employment,
    poor quality schools, failing public services, incompetent parents, and discrimination from the
    larger society could drive someone to violence - against
    oneself (i.e., substance abuse, self-mutilation, suicide) or against
    others. In addition, anger resulting from child abuse and
    poor role modeling often leads to violence against oneself and others.</p>

    <p>Complicating the picture is the impact of ex-convicts on the gang culture
    in hundreds of communities throughout the United States. Among the 600,000 inmates being released
    from prison annually into American society are those
    who were gang members prior to their incarceration and those who joined a
    gang for the first time while in prison. Both have an impact on the gang
    culture in the community to which they return.</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p><b><font size="2">Survey respondents for 1998 were
    asked how much their jurisdictions youth gang problem has been affected
    in the past few years by the return of gang-involved adults who have been in
    prison. Research suggests that involvement of ex-convicts in youth gangs
    increases the life of gangs and their level of violent crime, in part
    because of the ex-convicts' increased proclivity to violence following
    imprisonment and the visibility and history they contribute to youth gangs. </font>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Some of these ex-convicts bring with them a sense of gang loyalty and
    cooperation which may exceed that which is commonly found on the
    street. The prison environment has a tendency to cause an amalgamation
    of gangs in order to provide strength in numbers against other and more
    threatening groups in the
    prison. For example, I observed primarily African-American members of gangs such as the Crips,
    Bloods, and Black Gangster Disciples joining together to protect themselves against Hispanics and radical
    Caucasians in a federal prison. Members of different and normally
    conflicting Hispanic gangs had also
    formed a union. Where once they would conflict with one another, they now
    associated with one another to provide protection against the
    African-American and Anglo (Caucasian) inmates.</p>

    <p>Thinking of gangs as societies with cultures of their own aids in
    understanding them and their members more fully. A better understanding may aid in
    developing strategies for reducing gang activity and youth violence.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Every society offers its members something, whether it's
    a sense of belonging, power, affection, status, or something else of value
    to the recipient.&nbsp;What gang researchers have discovered is that, for many children
    in the United States, neighborhood and community social institutions
    which are supposed to provide these things are not ... gangs <i>are</i>. If we understand that, we can develop ways to
    provide these things to local youth legitimately so that joining a gang is not
