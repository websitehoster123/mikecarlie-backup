    strategies for dealing with&nbsp;gangs need to include many, if not all, of 
    the community's social

    a vested interest in making sure gangs do not dominate
    anywhere in their community. For example:</p>

    situation? Like the faith community, the business communities in the
    research cities seemed more involved in helping good kids stay good than in
    helping at-risk youth.&nbsp;Some of the businesses and business 
    organizations (i.e. Rotary, etc.) offered scholarships to stellar high
    school students and internships to the best academic performers but none 
    that I experienced offered
    scholarships to struggling ninth graders or internships to academic
    underachievers.</p>

	<p align="left"> Businesses, especially  small ones - which form the
    backbone of the American economy - have limited funds to spend on
    efforts to help at-risk youth. Large companies and business
    organizations (i.e., Dell, Kraft, 3M, Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions), and those with charitable foundations, do
    support a wide range of initiatives which may benefit youth at-risk of
    juvenile delinquency and/or gang involvement. But I did not find a
    local Chamber of Commerce undertaking or coordinating such efforts.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">So, What's the Big Deal?</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">A robust business community is a sign of a community's
    well-being. It signifies there are jobs for most people who want one and
    suggests most residents have a steady income. The income pays for health
    care, education, clothing, transportation, family entertainment, and all
    those things that we have come to know as making life a little more
    pleasant. Most people need jobs and they are used as a way of defining who
    the person is and are a measure of their worth.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>One of the major points of articulation
      between the inside world [of inner-city life] and the larger society
      surrounding it is in the area of employment. The way in which the man
      makes a living and the kind of living he makes have important consequences
      for how the man sees himself and is seen by others; and these in turn importantly
      shape his relationships with family members, lovers, friends, and
      neighbors.</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Liebow1967">Liebow</a>,

    <p align="left">The consequences of economic deprivation were <a href="GANGS/WHYFORM/economic_deprivation.htm">discussed
    previously</a> and suggest that the business sector should participate in offering
    opportunities for everyone in the community - including children. The
    participation of the business sector, along with the schools, faith community, social
    services, the family, and other social institutions, is what prevents or
    reduces gang formation.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">In the section of this book entitled <i>Solutions</i> we
    will explore some of the things a community's business sector could do to
    reduce the negative effect of gangs. For now, let's take a look at the mass
    media and their relationship to the gang phenomenon.</p>
