          <h2><a name="structure">Gang Structure</a></h2>
          <p>All gangs have identifiable levels of membership. These levels of
          membership indicate status within a gang and acts as the
          organizational maintenance systems. There are actually six levels of
          gang structure.</p>
          <h3>1. Leadership:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The leader(s) of a gang determines at what level of criminal
            activity the gang will function. Characteristics of the leader(s)
            are reflected in the day to day activities of the gang. The leader
            is all powerful.
          </blockquote>
          <h3>2. Hard Core:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The hard core gang members are usually the older gang members, the
            individuals who are culturally and criminally enmeshed in the gang
            and are at risk of being so for life. Most violent gang activity
            emanates from the hard core gang members. Hard core gang members
            usually make up about 10% of gang membership.
          </blockquote>
          <p align="center"><a name="structure"><img src="../../advisenet/ISSUES%20AND%20COOL%20SITES/gangstr.gif" width="400" height="312"></a>
          <h3>3. Associate:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The associate gang member has usually made a personal commitment to
            the gang culture and is dedicated to achieving the level of
            recognition needed to attain hard core status.
          </blockquote>
          <h3>4. Fringe:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The fringe gang member is still able to function outside of the gang
            structure and has not made a commitment to a life in the criminal
            gang culture. This type of member drifts in and out of the gang and
            seems to lack direction.
          </blockquote>
          <h3>5. Wanna-Bes:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Wanna-bes are not actually gang members. They are youth who view the
            gang as an exciting place to be, a place where they could become
            &quot;somebody&quot;. Wanna-bes may emulate gang dress, graffiti,
            hand signs, and other gang cultural symbols, and they may associate
            with known gang members, but they have not yet been excepted into
            the gang.
          </blockquote>
          <h3>6. Cliques:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Very seldom is the gang at full strength. Exceptions to this, of
            course, would be times of conflict or possibly at social functions.
            What is most often seen as &quot;the gang&quot; is usually a clique
            from within the larger gang. The clique is a group of associate,
            fringe, and often, wanna-be gang members who gravitate around one or
            more of the hard core gang members. This somewhat resembles a gang
            within a gang.

          <h2><a name="gang recruitment">Gang Recruitment Techniques</a></h2>
          <p>The needs and/or purpose of a gang as well as the particular
          situation determines the methods/techniques that will be used to
          recruit new members into the gang. The following categories of gang
          recruitment are fairly common, but the sophistication of the gang will
          certainly dictate how sophisticated the recruitment techniques will be
          implemented.</p>
          <h3>1. Seduction:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">For a long time gangs have used this technique to
            recruit new members. They create glorified myths about the gang that
            are very attractive to young recruits, and very often these myths
            become the foundation for young aspirations.&nbsp;
            <p align="left">The most powerful of these trappings, however, are
            the promise of money, sex, and glamour. The symbols of the gang (the
            graffiti, hand signs, colors, tattoos, etc.) create a visual
            attraction for young people, they realize that with these symbols
            they are part of something organized and powerful. Parties are also
            very useful ways for recruiters to seduce young people into the
            gang. At the party they have fun, get high, and believe the rhetoric
            they are bombarded with.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 align="left">2. Subterfuge:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">Subterfuge is a misrepresentation of what the gang
            really is and what it stands for. Recruiters use lies and schemes to
            convince the youth that it really isn't a gang, it's a club or it is
            really a group of close friends that have to protect themselves
            against a powerful enemy. Another tact taken by recruiters is to
            identify latchkey and other kids who may not have a good family life
            and convince them that they aren't loved and that the club is there
            for them, the &quot;club&quot; will love them.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 align="left">3. Obligation:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">Often gang members will do a favor or make a loan of
            something to a prospective recmit and demand that they give loyalty
            as payback. Often, these favors come in the form of protection.
            Girls are sometimes used to promote that sense of obligation.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 align="left">4. Cohersion:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">Forced recruitment is an age old technique, used
            most often by large gangs in chronic gang cities. This technique is
            used most often during times of gang conflict, or when there is a
            need to generate dues money. Coercion is usually accomplished by
            threats, but physical beatings are used as well. There have been
            many deaths as a result of individuals refusing to join the gang.
            Coercion can mean that a family member is threatened as well.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 align="left">5. Self Recruitment:</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">For many reasons, youth will make contact with gang
            members and ask to join the gang. The reasons are many and not
            always because the individual sees the gang as glamorous. The reason
            may be one of necessity, money, protection etc.. The reasons may be
            a combination of all of the trappings mentioned above. The range of
            reasons for a youth to join a gang is very wide and does not always
            mean that he has joined the gang openheartedly.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left">All of the recruitment strategies listed above can be
          elaborated on. Training is available to communities that can provide
          valuable information about gang recruitment and what can be done about
          it.</p>

          <h2 align="left"><a name="The Gang as a Criminal Enterprise">The Gang
          as a Criminal Enterprise</a></h2>
          <p align="left">Of the many issues that gangs of the 90's have
          addressed, in their own fashion, the one that has, and will continue
          to have, the most impact on the American Community, is the expansion
          of gang enterprise. Not only is gang enterprise an increasingly
          acceptable means of illegal income, it is also another profound
          statement of counter-rejection by young people to the larger society.</p>
          <p align="left">According to national statistics, about 95% of hard
          core gang members are high school drop-outs. It is said by these gang
          members that school cannot prepare them to survive in this society.
          Many of the schools they attend have a &quot;0&quot; academic level.
          They know that four years of high school will not prepare them for
          college, which means that the job market will not be open to them on a
          competitive level. In essence, they have created a system of education
          and a system of employment that is much more responsive to their
          needs.</p>
          <p align="left">While much attention has been given to the association
          of street gangs with drugs, there has been little public discussion of
          the economics of this association. In the past, those street gangs
          that depended upon crime as a source of income were limited to the
          traditional methods of extortion, robbery and burglary as a means of
          providing that income. Because of the opportunistic nature of such
          crimes, coupled with the risk of personal injury and/or being sent to
          jail, many of the gang members could be lured away from the gang by
          positive alternatives such as: a chance to learn a skill and obtain
          gainful employment.</p>
          <p align="left">The availability of cocaine and the ease with which it
          can be converted to &quot;crack&quot; has changed the route through
          which the gang obtains its income and as a direct result, the nature
          of the gangs response of offers of positive alternatives. By way of
          illustration, consider the following:<br>
          <br>
          On an initial investment of $2,500.00 worth of cocaine and using two
          readily available household chemicals, $10,000.00 worth of
          &quot;crack&quot; can be produced. In areas of high demand it is not
          unusual for a gang to &quot;turn over&quot; (increase the profit on)
          its initial investment by a factor of four. Therefore, the $10,000.00
          worth of crack becomes $40,000.00 by the end of the day.</p>
          <p align="left">Typically the gang will employ one person to collect
          the money for the drugs, one person to deliver the drug to the buyer
          and two look outs/security men. Their pay can be as low as $50.00 per
          day each. Often a percentage is offered to the team for sales over a
          certain amount per day.</p>
          <p align="left">If the $200.00 per day cost of the team is deducted,
          the profit for the day would be $29,800.00. That's tax free money and
          continues seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year.</p>
          <p align="left">In light of these facts, it becomes clearer why gangs
          resort to violence in disputes over the best sales areas and why the
          mere offer of a job at minimum wage does not readily deter a youth
          from this profitable enterprise.</p>
          <p align="left">Gang enterprise, justified through the gang system of
          values, incorporated into the gang structure, and embraced by the gang
          as an acceptable economic foundation for the gang society, will prove
          to be a monumental challenge for communities determined to eliminate
          the gang phenomenon.</p>
