    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The Social <a name="Institutional"> Institutional</a> Perspective</font></b></p>
    <p>My academic training is as a <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#Sociology"> sociologist</a> and social
    psychologist. When sociologists look at a
    city or town they see more than the individuals who live there. In addition
    to the built environment or physical infrastructure (i.e., parks, streets,
    buildings), they see the
    social institutions people have created - social institutions which give
    meaning to the residents' lives and which help them achieve personal and collective
    goals.</p>
    <p>A social institution consists of a group of people organized to
    achieve a unique goal. Families are organized to procreate
    (create new human beings), to provide intimate nurturing, and help socialize
    the society's children. Faith institutions identify and nurture positive social values and help us answer
    such questions as &quot;Why am I here?,&quot; &quot;What is the purpose of
    life?, and &quot;Is there such a
    thing as 'good' and 'evil'?&quot;</p>
    <p>Commerce is a social institution designed to provide a means of earning
    income while schools have developed to educate youth so that they can
    communicate with and participate in the larger society and find a means of employment.
    Other social
    institutions - like the military, health care, the media, government, and
    the criminal justice system - each address a different set of problems and
    have unique goals to accomplish.</p>
    <p>A <i>social institutional perspective</i> is one which views
    communities as a collection of these social institutions and views the
    residents of the community as their members. Where
    social institutions are present and healthy, sociologists speak of social
    organization. Where they are non-existent or weak, we speak of
    social <b>dis</b>organization. Gang members are most commonly found living in socially
    disorganized neighborhoods.<font class="TimesRoman18" size="2"><b> </b></font><font class="TimesRoman18" size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#BowkerKlein1983">Bowker

    <p>In neighborhoods with vital and robust social institutions, <b>
    <a name="informal">
    informal</a></b> controls exist which reduce the likelihood of gang formation.
    Family members, school personnel, and faith community leaders provide these
    informal controls over the youth in their charge.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">Loosely speaking, [informal social control] refers to
    the capacity of a community or neighborhood to police itself. Informal
    social control occurs, for example, when residents of a neighborhood are
    willing to confront juveniles engaging in vandalism, report truancy to
    school authorities or play an active role in supervising teenage social
    activity. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Weatherburn2001">Weatherburn</a>,
    2001)</font><font size="2">&nbsp; </font><b><font size="2">Areas with
    reduced levels of informal social control have been found to have higher
    rates of crime and violence. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Sampsonetal1997">Sampson
    et al.</a>, 1997)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In neighborhoods characterized by social <b>dis</b>organization, the social
    institutions which should be providing informal control over their youth are
    not doing so. The justice system, in most cases, is then required to impose
    its <b> formal</b> social control through arrests, formal processing, and court mandated
    treatment and punishment.</p>
    <p>When I told my colleagues I was going to ride with police gang units and study gangs some of them
    asked &quot;Why bother? It's all about their families, isn't
    it?&quot; I had made a promise to myself that I would remain open minded about
    such things, but common sense would seem to have supported their conclusion.
    My experience in the field turned all of
    that upside down.</p>
    <p>What I've come to believe is that, from a social institutional
    perspective, for a family to be healthy it must be supported by other social
    institutions in the community ... and those social institutions must
    themselves be strong.</p>
    <p>I liken this to a three-legged
    stool. One leg is education (our schools), the second leg is commerce
    (the world of work), and the third leg is the faith community (values). They
    each support and contribute to the strength of the platform - the seat - which is the family.
    If any
    one of the legs is weak or missing, the stool will fall.</p>
    <p>To be more accurate, the stool would have to have more than three legs. It would have one for each
    social institution in the community (health care, media, government, etc.). But the analogy is, I hope, clear.
    <b>For families to be healthy they need the support of other social institutions in
    the community</b>. If a father or mother can not find a meaningful job,
    if the children do not get an education that makes them employable, and if the
    values of the family are undeveloped or socially inappropriate, what hope
    does that family or child have for success?<a name="healthy"></a></p>
    <p>Having healthy social institutions in the community, however, is not enough. The
    family itself must be healthy. In the <i>Solutions</i> section of <i>Into
    the Abyss</i> we will explore various qualities of a healthy family.</p>
    <p>While most single-parent families produce
    children who do not become gang members, there is a body of research which suggests a disproportionate number of gang members come from
    single-parent
    families, or they don't have parents, or their parents are
    less-than-desirable role models (i.e., participating in child abuse, violence,
    involved in substance abuse or gangs).</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font class="TimesRoman18" size="2">Insofar as the proposed link
    between gangs and fatherless families is valid, one would expect that
    communities with gangs would have more female-headed households than other
    communities and that an increase in the number of female-headed households
    would lead to an increase in the number of gangs. Available data support
    both assumptions. </font> </b><font class="TimesRoman18" size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>,

    <p>A social institutional perspective leads one to view communities as a
    collection of social institutions and the solutions to social problems in
    the community as dependent upon the health of those social institutions. That is the
    background against which this book was written. It will attribute much of what is causing gang formation
    to the social structure of the neighborhoods in which they are found and, in similar fashion,
    will
    identify solutions as being related to those social institutions.<font class="TimesRoman18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The <a name="Spigot">Spigot</a> and the Spill</font></b></p>
    <p>The word <i>spigot</i> isn't being used much anymore. It's an old fashioned word that refers to a device that turns things <i>on</i>
    and <i>off</i>. I like to use it in the phrase &quot;the spigot
    and the spill&quot; because it sounds better than &quot;the faucet and the
    spill.&quot; It must be the songwriter in me that makes me do that.</p>
    <p>I use the phrase as a metaphor when I am asked to talk about gangs. There
    is a great deal of attention being focused today on gangs, gang members, and
    their <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#Associates" name="associates">associates</a>.
    Using the metaphor, we are focused on the <i>spill</i> - on those who are
    already involved in the gang life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When I use the word spigot in the metaphor I am refer to <b> turning off the
    problems which are causing the spill</b> - things like child abuse, absent
    or dysfunctional parents, substance abuse, and school failure (which may be the result of the
    other influences).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This perspective suggests we should be focused more on reducing the problems which cause
    gangs to form and lead people to join them at an early age rather than on
    simply identifying who the gang members are and arresting them (that's
    focusing on the spill). <i>Into the Abyss</i> is concerned with both identifying the causes of
    gang formation and gang joining in identify ways in which to remove the
    causes.</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000">Introduction</font></b></p>
    <p>While the local nature of gangs may be obvious (i.e., seeing groups of youths
    displaying colors, throwing hand signs, wearing tattoos, referring to one
    another with gang <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#moniker">monikers</a>), the national connection may not be
    as apparent to some. The connection between local gang activity and the national gang scene is
    clear to criminal justice practitioners, gang researchers, and others
    familiar with gangs and is revealed in a variety of ways.</p>

    <p>Of
    great concern is the movement of documented gang members from one community

    <p>Knowing that gangs are fluid - moving not only from one community to
    another, but moving within communities - is one of the perspectives that
    formed a backdrop against which this book was written and will be discussed
    later in greater detail.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">The <a name="relationship"> relationship</a> between
    violence in the media and
    violence in society</font></b></p>
    <p>By &quot;media&quot; I refer to
    mass media - the most powerful and visual being movies, television, music, and the
    Internet. Youth around the world are exposed to the mass media and its
    messages.</p>
    <p>I've been teaching a course on
    crime and the media since 1987. According to the literature,
    there is no conclusive proof that violence in the media causes violence in society.
    Rather, there are two distinctly different positions taken by those who
    conduct research on this relationship. One position suggests violence in the media has
    a cathartic effect on its audience while the other position suggests it has a stimulating
    effect.</p>
    <p>The cathartic effect is a purging of violent feelings. By watching
    violence in the media, in other words, observers vent their own feelings of rage or
    anger. The stimulating effect is just the
    opposite. It suggests that observing violence in the media leads
    viewers to act out and behave violently. Although not thoroughly
    researched, the
    &quot;copy cat&quot; phenomenon
    (seeing a crime committed and copying it) may be one example of the stimulating effect.</p>
    <p> What impact does gang-related content found in movies, television, music,
    and the Internet have on its audience of young people? Does it stimulate
    them to emulate gang behavior or act as a release valve for their
    frustrations and anger?</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Movies">Movies</a> and Television</font></b></p>
    <p>In the 1970's the wearing of colors by gangs in the Los
    Angeles area was commonplace, but it was not commonplace elsewhere in the
    United States. That is, not until the movie <i>Colors</i> was
    shown in movie theaters across the country. Within days, police departments began reporting they were seeing youths wearing colors in association with the gangs to which they belonged.</p>
    <p>Since that time more gang-themed movies have
    been produced. What impact do
    these movies have on their young audiences? If <i>Colors</i> had such
    a significant impact, is it possible that the newer movies are having a similar impact?</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.gangwar.com">Steve Nawojczyk</a> is a respected gang
    researcher and community activist. I asked him to shed a little light for me
    on the subject of
    movies, kids, and gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">I once spoke to a group of inner-city kids,
      they were a pretty hard-core bunch who had seen a lot of things in their
      short lives. In my lecture, I ask a series of questions, one of
      which is 'Do movies move kids to violence?'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">As usual, the group sort of chattered among
      themselves before a girl of about 15 stood up and said, &quot;No, unless your
      screws aren't in tight.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused for a minute and then
      continued,&quot;'...and you know what? I know a lot of kids whose screws
      aren't in tight.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>She closed with the most profound part of her
      pronouncement,&nbsp;<br>
      &quot;And you know what else? There is no one there
      to help 'em keep their screws in tight.&quot; I think that says it all. </b></font><font size="1">(Email, 6 June, 2001, with permission.)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>More conclusive evidence of a causal relationship between
    the content of mass media and the occurrence of gangs or violence is needed,
    but it may
    be nearly impossible to find. In order to prove
    gang-themed movies and violence in movies cause some viewers to form or
    join gangs or participate in violence we would need a control group of people who
    have never seen gang-themed or violent media presentations. I don't
    think we're going to find them.</p>
    <p>According to researchers associated with the Office

    <p>Today's
    music includes such categories as <i>gangsta rap</i> and <i>hip hop</i>. The lyrics of some of these songs
    tell a story of inner-city life filled with violence and guns. Guns are
    portrayed as a means of reaching and maintaining manhood and suggest an overall
    devaluing of human life and society's social institutions (common targets
    are the family,
    religion, schools, and the criminal justice system). The music is
    available to children of many nations as broadcast on MTV, the Internet, on the radio,
    and in stores.</p>

      <p><font size="2"><b>In the 1950's, the musical drama <i>West
      Side Story</i> portrayed gang life as seen through the eyes of adult
      middle-class writers and presented themes of honor, romantic love, and
      mild rebellion consistent with the values and perspectives of these
      writers. In the 1990's, the substance of gang life was communicated to
      national audiences through a new medium known as gangsta rap. For the
      first time, this lifestyle was portrayed by youthful insiders, not adult
      outsiders.&nbsp;</b></font>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The character and values of gang life
      described by the rappers differed radically from the images of <i>West
      Side Story</i>. Language was rough and insistently obscene; women were
      prostitutes (&quot;bitches,&quot; &quot;ho's,&quot; and &quot;sluts&quot;)
      to be used, beaten, and thrown away; and extreme violence and cruelty, the
      gang lifestyle, and craziness or insanity were glorified. Among the
      rappers' targets of hatred, scorn, and murder threats were police,
      especially black police (referred to as &quot;house slaves&quot; and
      &quot;field hands&quot;); other races and ethnic groups; society as a
      whole; and members of rival gangs.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The target audience for gangsta rap
      was adolescents at all social levels, with middle-class suburban youth
      constituting a substantial proportion of the market for rap recordings.
      The medium had its most direct appeal, however, for children and youth in
      ghetto and barrio communities, for whom it identified and clarified a set
      of values, sentiments, and attitudes about life conditions that were
      familiar to them.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The obscene and bitterly
      iconoclastic gangsta rappers assumed heroic stature for thousands of

      a gang subculture that was portrayed by the rappers as a glamorous and

    <p>At
    one and the same time, the Internet is friend and foe to those concerned
    about the well being of children. As a friend, it provides
    information and entertainment that is valuable and healthy. As a foe, it connects
    youths to sites that invite participation in deviance. Some of the sites expose youth to ideas and
    images that are not healthy. And they are accessible from
    anywhere in the world, as long as there is a connection to the
    Internet.</p>
    <p>While the international and national gang connections are real, the fact is that the only real hope for
    reducing the attractiveness of gangs to our youth is to address the
    phenomenon at the local level. This may require a two-pronged
    approach. On the one hand there is a need to address the national
    influences as identified above (e.g., remain alert and responsive to immigrating
    gang members and limit exposure to inappropriate media messages). On the other, we need to focus on the basic human needs of
    our local youth and be vigilant in serving those needs. In the <i>Solutions</i>
    section of this book we will address those needs.</p>

    <p>The social policy our nation has adopted towards drugs currently listed
    as illegal may have created more problems than it has solved. Much like the
    prohibition of alcohol in the early 1900's, our
    policies on drugs have created an environment conducive to the formation and growth of
    gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">The most common explanation for the increase in youth
      gang problems, and one particularly favored by law enforcement personnel,
      centers on the growth of the drug trade. Historically, youth gangs have
      engaged in a variety of illegal income-producing activities, including
      extortion, robbery, and larceny. In the 1980's, according to this
      argument, the increasing availability and widening market for illegal
      drugs, particularly crack cocaine, provided new sources of income.</font></b>
      <p><b><font size="2">The relative ease with which large sums of money
      could be obtained by drug trafficking provided a solid financial
      underpinning for gangs, increased the solidarity of existing gangs, and
      offered strong incentives for the development of new ones.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">As gangs fought one another over control of the drug
      trade in local areas, the level of inter-gang violence rose and, in the
      process, increased gang cohesion and incentives to form alliances with
      other gangs. These developments, along with market requirements, resulted
      in widespread networks of drug-dealing gangs. The clear model here is that
      of organized crime during Prohibition, with rival mobs fighting over
      markets and forming alliances and rivalries with other mobs.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">This argument appears to have considerable power in
      accounting for the growth of gangs, and there is little doubt that the
      drug trade was one important factor in that growth. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>,

    <p>Making certain drugs illegal has spawned an
    illicit and dangerous industry similar to the crime organizations which evolved to
    manufacture, distribute, and sell alcohol when it was prohibited in the United
    States. As a result of their current illegality, and the continued demand for them, their
    price has escalated and the danger associated with their
    manufacture/cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, and use has also
    escalated.</p>
    <p>The distribution of illicit drugs and the nature of the organizations
    which deal in them are national concerns which play themselves out
    on the local scene - in our communities. This observation also forms a
    portion of the
    perspective being brought to the writing of this book.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Gangs are not <i> the</i> <a name="problem">problem</a>.</font></b></p>
    <p>If we want to reduce the amount of crime being committed we must first
    understand that criminal behavior is not the problem. Rather, criminal behavior is a symptom of the problems
    which are causing people to violate the
    law.</p>
    <p> When we speak of something as a <i>problem</i> we often refer
    to its cure as a <i>solution</i>. If the problem is misdiagnosed, the solution
    will likely fail. <b>I believe we have misdiagnosed the problem when it
    comes to gangs.</b> Gangs
    are not the problem. The problem is whatever it is that is causing gangs
    to form. If we can identify those causes I believe we can effectively reduce 
    gang activity and youth violence. I will address the causes - the
    <i>real</i> problems - when we look at 
    <a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm">why gangs form</a> later in the book.</p>
    <p>When <i> gangs</i> are identified as the problem, most communities resort 
    to arresting gang members and assume gang activity will then be reduced.
    Communities across the country have learned this approach doesn't work.
    In fact, it may backfire.</p>
    <p>Arresting gang members is like anointing them. It showers them with
    respect from other gang members, almost as much as does serving time in
    prison. And while in prison, there is much gang members learn and there will
    be other gang members with whom
    they will associate. Upon being released into the community (and over 95% of
    all incarcerated men
    and women are eventually released), they may become more of a
    danger to the community than they were before they were arrested (i.e., they
    are angrier, nearly unemployable as ex-convicts, new gang alliances may have
    been fostered in prison, they have increased status on the street as
    ex-cons).</p>
    <p>The point I am trying to make is that using suppression against gang
    members (i.e., arrest, conviction, incarceration) as the
    <i> only</i> tool
    for reducing gang activity and youth violence will probably fail.</p>

    school failure, and all the other things we know about which cause youths to join a
    gang, we might be able to reduce gang activity.</p>
