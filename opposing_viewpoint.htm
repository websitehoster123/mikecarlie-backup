		<p align="left">On May 12th, 2009, I received the following email in 
		which Heath Lee objected to the way in which Tupac was characterized in 
		this <b><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Field Note</font></b>. This is 
		what Mr. Lee sent to me:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><b><font size="2">&quot;I'm a Junior Psychology student 
			at ______ University. I was reading through <i>Into the Abyss</i> 
			and came across this statement concerning gang culture: “</font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">He 
			also shared his frustration and disgust with the fact that Ice T 
			(the gangster rapper) is a documented gang member.&quot; Gangster rap not 
			only glorifies being a gangster, Ice T is living proof that 
			gangsters <i>are</i> glorified and can even&nbsp; become popular 
			recording artists. 2 Pac, of course, would be another example of 
			this, but gang banging resulted in his premature death.&quot;</span></b></p>
			<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: 700">
			I'm also a big Tupac Shakur fan and have studied a great deal about 
			Tupac. To the point now, yes there is some evidence that Tupac was a 
			member of the Bloods but he wasn’t a “gang banger” he repeatedly 
			said that he was NOT a “gangster rapper,&quot; you would know this if you 
			were to watch the extras in his documentary Resurrection. He is 
			being questioned while in jail I believe, and they ask him about 
			gangster rap, he says he has never had a song that was gangster rap.
			</span></p>
			<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: 700">
			I'm not saying that he was not a member of a gang, I'm not saying 
			that him being a member of a gang didn’t lead to his premature 
			death, and I'm not saying he was perfect. But it just struck a nerve 
			when u put him in the same category as Ice T. Seriously that’s very 
			demeaning to him and his memory, Tupac was 5 times the man that Ice 
			T could ever be, sure he did a lot of things that weren’t good and 
			that I don’t agree with, but he also did a lot of things to try and 
			help people, like holding the TRUC PICNIC where he got members of 
			the Bloods and Crips to sign the Code of Thug Life. He also started 
			Joshua’s Dream Corporation and Euphanasia which were to help the 
			community. </span></p>
			<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: 700">I 
			don’t know if you know anything about Tupac other than he was a 
			rapper, if not I ask you to please research him a little. Like I 
			said, he was in no way perfect, but I'm sure you will find out that 
			he was in no way the same type of person that Ice T is. Tupac was 
			way more than just a rapper, he said himself that he didn’t want to 
			rap for much longer, he wanted to do something that would help 
			change the world, little did he know that he did help change the 
			world through his music alone. He was a poet and a fallen angel!</span></p>

		subjects.</p>
