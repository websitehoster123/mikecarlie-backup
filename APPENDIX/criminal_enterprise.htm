				<p align="left">Of the many issues that gangs of the 90's have addressed, in
					their own fashion, the one that has, and will continue to have, the most
					impact on the American Community, is the expansion of gang enterprise. Not
					only is gang enterprise an increasingly acceptable means of illegal income,
					it is also another profound statement of counter-rejection by young people
					to the larger society.</p>
				<p align="left">According to national statistics, about 95% of hard core
					gang members are high school drop-outs. It is said by these gang members
					that school cannot prepare them to survive in this society. Many of the
					schools they attend have a &quot;0&quot; academic level. They know that four
					years of high school will not prepare them for college, which means that the
					job market will not be open to them on a competitive level. In essence, they
					have created a system of education and a system of employment that is much
					more responsive to their needs. </p>
				<p align="left">While much attention has been given to the association of
					street gangs with drugs, there has been little public discussion of the
					economics of this association. In the past, those street gangs that depended
					upon crime as a source of income were limited to the traditional methods of
					extortion, robbery and burglary as a means of providing that income. Because
					of the opportunistic nature of such crimes, coupled with the risk of
					personal injury and/or being sent to jail, many of the gang members could be
					lured away from the gang by positive alternatives such as: a chance to learn
					a skill and obtain gainful employment.</p>
				<p align="left">The availability of cocaine and the ease with which it can
					be converted to &quot;crack&quot; has changed the route through which the
					gang obtains its income and as a direct result, the nature of the gangs
					response of offers of positive alternatives. By way of illustration,
					consider the following:<br>
					<br>
					On an initial investment of $2,500.00 worth of cocaine and using two readily
					available household chemicals, $10,000.00 worth of &quot;crack&quot; can be
					produced. In areas of high demand it is not unusual for a gang to &quot;turn
					over&quot; (increase the profit on) its initial investment by a factor of
					four. Therefore, the $10,000.00 worth of crack becomes $40,000.00 by the end
					of the day.
				</p>
				<p align="left">Typically the gang will employ one person to collect the
					money for the drugs, one person to deliver the drug to the buyer and two
					look outs/security men. Their pay can be as low as $50.00 per day each.
					Often a percentage is offered to the team for sales over a certain amount
					per day.</p>
				<p align="left">If the $200.00 per day cost of the team is deducted, the
					profit for the day would be $29,800.00. That's tax free money and continues
					seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year.</p>
				<p align="left">In light of these facts, it becomes clearer why gangs resort
					to violence in disputes over the best sales areas and why the mere offer of
					a job at minimum wage does not readily deter a youth from this profitable
					enterprise.</p>
				<p align="left">Gang enterprise, justified through the gang system of
					values, incorporated into the gang structure, and embraced by the gang as an
					acceptable economic foundation for the gang society, will prove to be a
					monumental challenge for communities determined to eliminate the gang
					phenomenon.</p>
