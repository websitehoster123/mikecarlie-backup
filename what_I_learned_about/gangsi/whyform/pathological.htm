<p>Some youths are abnormal or pathological, filled with anger and rage and easily
    provoked into violence. They are marginalized by their families,
    school teachers and administrators, justice personnel, and others. Time spent in confinement for their acts brings
    them into association with other youths who exhibit similar tendencies. They
may begin to associate while in confinement and continue their relationship upon
their return to the community. Alone or together, they may also form a gang by recruiting
other disaffected youths to join them
    in their activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lewis Yablonsky is a well established American gang researcher whose
    research on gangs began in the 1960's. A key element in his latest
    work, <i>Gangsters: Fifty Years of Madness, Drugs, and Death on the Streets
of America</i> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Yablonsky1997">1997</a>),</font>
addresses the pathological nature of some gang members - particularly core members and
instigators of violent gang activities. According to Yablonsky</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Most violent-gang behavior is sociopathic; however, many but
      certainly not all gangsters can be characterized as having sociopathic
      personalities. A comprehensive analysis of the concept
      of sociopathology and the sociopathic personality, in my view, is vital to
      understanding gangsters and the overall gang problem.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>[Gang members'] pathology becomes most apparent in their
      [lack of
      remorse in the] treatment of other people. In contrast with my view
      of violent gangsters as sociopaths, some gang theorists and researchers
      persist in perceiving contemporary gangs as 'families' and normal
      adolescent groupings. These viewpoints present a distorted
      perception of gangs as normal rather than pathological
      collectivities. The sociopath factor explains how and why gangsters
      can kill without remorse or regret. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Yablonsky1997">Yablonsky</a>,
      1997, pp. 101-103)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
<p>Yablonsky's research confirmed an observation I made in the
    field when he wrote</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2"><b>A gangster can commit horrendous
    acts of violence in the context of gangbanging, and it is sanctioned by his
    gang. After a period of participating in a variety of dehumanized acts
    ... they tend to become unfeeling. Through this gang process of
    desensitizing their behavior, they become capable of committing spontaneous
    acts of senseless violence without feeling concern or guilt. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Yablonsky1997">Yablonsky</a>,
    1997, p. 21)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gangs not only provide a setting in which pathological offenders may act out their aggression, some gangs encourage
that behavior. For example, gang initiation ceremonies ritualize aggression. Acts of
    aggression against rival gang members are expected, perceived of as normal,
    and often rewarded. They include beatings, mutilations, drive-by-shootings,
and murder.</p>
<p><a name="Samenow"></a>In his book entitled <i>Inside the Criminal Mind, </i>Stanton E. Samenow 
states that </p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><font size="2">Criminals cause crime - not bad neighborhoods, inadequate 
parents, television, schools, drugs, or unemployment. Crime resides within the 
minds of human beings and is not caused by social conditions. Once we as a 
society recognize this simple fact, we shall take measures radically different 
from current ones. To be sure, we shall continue to remedy intolerable social 
conditions, for this is worthwhile in and of itself. But we shall not expect 
criminals to change because of such efforts. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">Samenow</a>, 
p. 6)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Samenow doesn't refer to delinquents and criminals as pathological. Rather, 
he believes 
it is the way they think that results in their delinquent or criminal behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2"><b>We must understand how criminals think and realize that 
they have a fundamentally different view of the world from that of people who 
are basically responsible. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
p. 5)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Behavior is largely a product of thinking. Everything we do 
is preceded, accompanied, and followed by thinking... (A) criminal is not 
equipped to be responsible... The criminal must learn to identify and then 
abandon thinking patterns that have guided his behavior for years. He must be 
taught new thinking patterns that are self-evident and automatic for responsible 
people but are totally foreign to him.</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
pp. 6-7)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Samenow is convinced that the traditional and widely accept way of thinking 
about criminality - that it is &quot;symptomatic of a deep-seated psychological or 
sociological problem&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
p. 9) </font>- is fundamentally incorrect and has led us to offer solutions for 
reducing delinquency and criminality which are ineffective and inappropriate.</p>
<p>As to the tendency to psychologize offenders, Samenow states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2"><b>We, the public, may be so revolted by the gruesomeness of a 
crime that we conclude that only a sick person would be capable of such an act. 
But our personal reaction is totally irrelevant to understanding the criminal. 
True, what these (offenders do) is not a normal, everyday event. But the key 
question is, what are these (offenders) really like? A detailed and lengthy 
examination of the mind of a criminal will reveal that it is anything but sick. 
The criminal is rational, calculating, and deliberate in his actions. </b>
</font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
p. 10)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the argument that delinquent children and their older 
counterparts began their deviance as a result of being rejected, Samenow writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
<p><b><font size="2">Criminals claim that they were rejected by parents, 
neighbors, schools, and employers, but rarely does a criminal say why he was 
rejected.&nbsp; Even as a young child, he was sneaky and defiant, and the older 
he grew, the more he lied to his parents, stole and destroyed their property, 
and threatened them. He made life at home unbearable and he turned even 
innocuous requests into a battleground. He conned his parents to get whatever he 
wanted, or else we wore them down through endless argument. It was the criminal 
who rejected his parents rather than visa versa.&quot;</font></b><font size="2">
</font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
pp. 12-13)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Samenow tells us that sociological explanations for the cause of delinquency 
or criminality are &quot;simplistic.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
p. 13)&nbsp; </font>He states that:</p>
  <blockquote>
<p><font size="2"><b>If (sociological explanations for crime) were correct, we'd 
have far more criminals than we do. Most poor people are law-abiding, and most 
kids from broken homes are not delinquents. Children may bear the scars of 
neglect and deprivation for life, but most do not become criminals. The 
environment does have an effect, but people perceive and react to similar 
conditions of life very differently. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
p. 13)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Concerning gangs, Samenow points out that not all families living in 
gang-infested neighborhoods have children who get involved in the gangs. <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
p. 13) </font>&nbsp;Similarly, how would sociologists explain the fact that 
families living in prosperous suburbs sometimes have children who are involved 
in gangs?</p>
<p>In summary, Samenow states that &quot;No factor or set of factors - sociological, 
psychological, or biological - is sufficient to explain why a person becomes a 
criminal.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Samenow1984">ibid</a>, 
pp. 19-20) </font>&nbsp;While Samenow's focus is upon becoming delinquent, there 
may be something of value in his perspective as concern why some youths get 
involved in gangs (a form of delinquency) or not. Perhaps the emphasis on the 
sociological and psychological explanations for gang formation and gang joining 
are, at least in part, mistaken. We may need to focus more on the way gang youth 
think and be more concerned about changing their thinking patterns.</p>
<p>What is certain is that the causes of gang formation and gang joining are 
many. No one explanation will suffice and, as Samenow reminds us, no one 
perspective (i.e., sociological or psychological) will suffice. </p>

mentor of mine told me many years ago. He said &quot;Bad families don't ruin good 
children. Bad children ruin otherwise good families.&quot;</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>While there are gangs with a core membership of pathological offenders, this
alone does not explain the formation of all gangs. The migration of gang members from
    one community to another may
    also contribute to their formation.</p>
