            1. Poor

            may lead to truancy and dropping out of school. This, in

            2. Some neighborhood schools are failing in their effort to educate and
            socialize students which may result in a child's rejection of
            school and the formation of a gang as a mechanism for filling time,
            acting out against the school, acquiring skills needed to make

    <p align="left">This part of <i>Into the Abyss</i> and the next section both
    deal with self-esteem. In order for our discussion about school failure to make sense
    we need to have a shared understanding of what <i>self-esteem</i> is and how
    it develops in an individual. &quot;Esteem&quot; refers to the regard in which someone is
    held by others. If they are held in &quot;high&quot; esteem, they are thought of
    positively. People who have high self-esteem regard themselves as
    good people - they are satisfied with themselves, confident. They have a
    sense of self-worth and self-competence. People with low self-esteem think poorly of themselves.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Some children are able to build high self-esteem at
    home. Their parents or guardians reward them for positive behaviors thus fostering the
    development of high self-esteem. These are children who are proud of what
    they do and who feel good about themselves. Other children are struggling at home. They are abused,
    neglected, and generally made to feel as though they are worthless. These
    children are likely to develop low self-esteem and will feel badly about
    themselves. They also have a propensity to feel negatively towards others.</p>

    <p align="left">Schools are also a social institution in which a child may
    develop either high- or low self-esteem. When children succeed at school -
    earn good grades, are respected by their teachers - they may develop high
    self-esteem. When children fail in school - when teachers punish or ridicule
    them - they are likely to develop a low level of self-esteem.</p>

    <p align="left">The jury is out on whether there is a direct relationship
    between low self-esteem and the risk of becoming a gang member. <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Thornberry2001">Thornberry</a>,
    2001, p. 36)</font> However, a persistent correlation has been found to
    exist between poor academic performance and delinquency. There are at least three explanations for
    this correlation.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">One suggests that a student's poor academic performance
    eventually leads to delinquency. Another suggests that it is the schools which are failing,
    thus producing children who are ill-equipped for the future and who may
    become involved in delinquency as a means of compensating for their
    deficiencies. The last explanation suggests school failure and delinquency are each caused by
    a third factor- problem behavior syndrome - and, therefore, neither poor academic
    performance nor failing schools are to blame for a child's delinquency.</p>
    <p align="left">As you read about these various notions, perhaps you will
    agree that, while none have been proven
    to lead directly to the formation of gangs, each is suggestive in its own way.</p>

            may lead to truancy and dropping out. As I witnessed over the past
    three years, some children who are truant socialize with other truant
    children and social groups begin to form. While the likelihood of the group
    becoming a gang is uncertain, the potential is there.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">A gang may form in order for its members to gain a sense of
    self-esteem <i>vis a vis</i> their role and activities in the gang. Within
    the gang students will also find alibis for their truancy, other children to
    socialize with, and a venue for venting any humiliation, frustration, or
    anger they may feel as a result of their failures in the school setting.</p>

    <p align="left">According to Cohen, some lower-class children fail to
    measure up to the middle-class values and feel
    frustrated as a result of their inability to measure up to the school's
    expectations. He believes some of these frustrated children will <i>act out</i> by
    turning the middle-class values upside down.</p>

    <p align="left">By acting out he suggests that courtesy becomes rudeness. Respect for property become
    vandalism. The need to control aggression becomes fighting, and so on. Of
    course such behavior is defined as delinquent so those who violate the
    middle-class standards are deviants, delinquents. Children who behave
    inappropriately are grouped together - in the principle's office, in detention,
    and in treatment programs.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The informal association which takes place between them in
    those settings may
    lead to gang formation as their relationships with each other mature. As Cohen
    indicated, &quot;The gang provides a legitimate 'opportunity structure' for
    working-class boys to strike back at a larger society that produces their

    School</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">Let's shift the topic a little now and take a look at
    truancy and dropping out of school as they impact a child's behavior. There is a substantial body of literature which shows
    &quot;... the evidence is clear that poor school performance, truancy, and
    leaving school at a young age are connected to juvenile delinquency.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NAP2000">National
    Academy Press</a>, 2000, <a href="http://books.nap.edu/books/0309071933/html/13.html#pagetop">page</a>)&nbsp;</font>
    They are connected, or correlated. It hasn't been proven that
    one causes the other but the two appear together consistently.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Truancy may be the beginning of a
      lifetime of problems for students who routinely skip school. Because these
      students fall behind in their school work, many drop out of school.
      Dropping out is easier than catching up.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Truant students are at
      higher risk of being drawn into behavior involving drugs, alcohol, or
      violence. A California deputy assistant attorney who handles truancy cases
      says he has never seen a gang member who wasn't a truant first. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Garry1996">Garry</a>,

    <p align="left">Precise national data on the number of school children and
    dropouts who are members of gangs is very difficult, if not impossible, to
    obtain. There are isolated studies, among them a recent study in Chicago
    which found &quot;... 5 percent of elementary school children were
    affiliated with street gangs, as were 35 percent of high school
    dropouts.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Sheldon1997">Sheldon</a>,

    <p align="left">Present-day statistics alert us to the fact that there is a
    significant problem related to dropping out, and it impacts certain ethnic
    and racial groups differently. Hispanic Americans appear to be most at risk
    of dropping out and, as we learned <a href="../../gangs/racial_composition.htm#Hispanics">earlier</a>,
    they represent the largest single ethnic group of gang members in the United
    States today. The following are among the most recent and significant
    findings regarding the drop out phenomenon.</p>

      dropouts, four of the factors were related to self-esteem, feeling that

    <p align="left">Have you heard of <i>social promotion</i>? It is an
    unwritten policy wherein teachers allow students performing at substandard
    levels to promote into the next grade at school along with the children who
    performed well. In effect, they are consigning these socially promoted
    children to a questionable future.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">I understand why such promotions take place - teacher
    frustration and/or fear of the consequences of holding a child back for
    another year and/or the desire to keep students with other students of his
      or her age. But there are consequences for the children who are socially
      promoted. They are not prepared for the next year in school and are more
      likely to experience failure or other frustrations.</p>
      <p align="left">The situation at home is just as problematic for some
      inner-city children. Their parents are far
    from helpful. They detract from their child's school performance by
    discouraging attendance (so the parent can use the child to do something
    else - shopping, stealing, taking care of the parent), failing to tutor the
    child, and hindering teachers' efforts to help the child.</p>

      <p>Failing at school, for whatever reason, presents children and
      adolescents with a significant challenge. Illiteracy, a lack of exposure to positive roles models in the
    school (peers and teachers alike), and the frustrations which follow in the
    wake of academic failure lay the foundation for powerlessness and a loss of
    hope. The challenge for these children is to stay out of trouble, and to keep from associating
      with other children who are in a similar predicament. I think there are too
      many youth who have failed this challenge and, in their desperation, have
      come together and developed into gangs.</p>
      <p>School failure is but one of many explanations for the formation of
      gangs. A lack of self-esteem, or never having been confident or satisfied
      with one's self may also be contributing to the formation of gangs.</p>
