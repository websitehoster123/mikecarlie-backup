    <p>One of the questions I asked each gang member I interviewed was &quot;What do you think
    you'll be doing ten years from now?&quot; The common reply was
    &quot;I won't even be alive by then, so who gives a shit!&quot; The graffiti at the top of this page speaks to that sentiment.
    Jackson and McBride also addressed this issue when they wrote &quot;To
    convince a young person who is not sophisticated enough to see beyond
    tomorrow, that he must prepare for the future, can be an exercise in
    futility. <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JacksonMcBride2000">Jackson
    and McBride</a>, 2000, p. 17)</font></p>
    <p>Yablonsky
    addressed the same issue when he wrote&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>

    hopelessness.</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Yablonsky1997">Yablonsky</a>,

    <p>I didn't know what to expect when I started my field
    observations. I certainly did not expect to find hopelessness
    nearly everywhere I turned. It seemed to surface most often with older
    gang members, members who had lost fellow gang members through death or
    dismemberment, or who had been arrested, convicted, and sent to
    prison. The gang members I interviewed who were twenty years of age or older
    nearly all said they'd &quot;had enough&quot; of the gang life.</p>
    <p>When I asked them about their children I was told they were doing
    everything in their power to make sure their children did not get involved
    with gangs. They saw gangs as losing propositions. Even
    the <a href="../../../Resources/glossary.htm#Original">O.G.s</a> who had accumulated money, cars,
    apartments, and a few women on the side, felt this way.</p>
    <p>At first, it seems, a gang holds out the prospect of being accepted,
    loved, cared for, and protected. It creates an environment in which
    the new member feels a sense of belonging. There are
    opportunities to socialize, date, have sex, obtain drugs, and earn money. In this environment a youth may begin to have a sense of hope, of a future
    in the gang and a future for him- or herself. It invites the feeling of finally having control over one's life, of having the power to
    become someone.</p>
    <p>As I learned from many of the gang members I interviewed, however, in
    time these hopes become an illusion as gang members suffer the loss of fellow members,
    get arrested, spend time in jail or prison, deal with probation and parole
    officers, get hounded by the police, and have to deal with rival gang
    members. Ironically, they often become powerless in the face of such circumstances.</p>
    <p>Christian Molidor interviewed 15 female gang members ages 13 to 17 were confined in a residential treatment facility in Texas. They had all
    been arrested one to six times. In a summary of the study it was found that</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><b><font color="#008000">A majority carried
    knives to school on a daily basis, and said they had easy access to a gun
    ...</font></b> </font><b><font size="2" color="#008000">But the downside to gang
    membership included fear and paranoia ... The young women
    talked of watching their backside, knowing they might be shot, stabbed, or
    beaten by a rival gang at any moment. </font></b><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Molidor1996">Molidor</a>,
    1996, <a href="http://www.casanet.org/library/delinquency/teenage.htm">page</a>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Many of the explanations given for why gangs form are intertwined.
    Feeling powerless is one of them. Why does a child feel powerless? Could it
    have anything to do with the way in which the child is treated at home? Are
    the parents either overbearing and brutal or are they so out of control
    themselves that no one is in control of anything at home? Can children get feelings of powerlessness from the way they are
    treated at school by peers and school officials? We know all of these things
    are possible,
    and that it's possible for a innocent children to feel powerless when they
    are attacked by gang
    members on their own neighborhood streets.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This continuing sense of hopelessness and powerlessness, referred to by
    nearly every gang member interviewed, has a certain liberating effect. Why attempt to control one's behavior for fear of being penalized
    in the future when life
    is short and it doesn't mean anything anyway? &quot;That's what gives
    me guts.&quot; That's what fosters gang formation - the desire to control
    one's life and the circumstances which arise in it. The gang
    offers opportunities to acquire power by uniting youths in search of hope
    and the power to realize those hopes.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>Gangs are still
      largely populated by young people from disenfranchised neighborhoods
      characterized by overcrowding, high unemployment, high drop out rates,
      lack of social and recreational services, and a general feeling of
      hopelessness. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KochCrimeInstitute2001">Koch
      Crime Institute</a>, 2001)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But a lack of hope and power alone are insufficient as an explanation for the
    formation of gangs. Abuse, fear, and a lack of security may also contribute to their formation.</p>
