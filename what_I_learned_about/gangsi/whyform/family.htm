    <p>The National Science Foundation recently summarized the current state of
    affairs regarding families in the United States. Their report portrays the
    family as being in the midst of a struggle to survive the impact of social
    and economic changes.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>There is widespread agreement that the well-being of
      American society depends on the health of America's families. Consensus
      also exists that the social and economic changes of the last generation or
      more have made it increasingly difficult for families to raise the next
      generation successfully.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The list of changes is familiar - real incomes have
      declined since the early 1970s and have become more polarized, public
      schools are less able to meet the challenges of preparing a well-educated
      citizenry, married women have joined the work force in large numbers,
      divorce rates have increased dramatically, and a rising share of American
      children are being raised in single-parent households.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>These changes have posed challenges particularly for
      poor families, and also for racial and ethnic minorities. However, no
      segment of our society is immune to the effects of these changes, which
      have produced a growing sense of crisis even among the well-to-do.</b></font><font size="1">

    <p>&quot;The family is the most
    important agent of socialization in the United States, especially for
    children.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Schaefer2001">Schaefer</a>,
    2001, p. 101)&nbsp;</font> The <a href="../../../Resources/glossary.htm#Socialization"> socialization</a> process may be
    briefly defined as the way in which a culture's values are transmitted from one
    generation to the next. If a culture values human life, that value will be transmitted from
    parent to child through the process of socialization. If respect for another
    person's property is valued, that value will also be passed along. If adherence
    to society's laws are valued, the child will probably become be a law
    abiding adult because that value was passed along. A myriad of values are transmitted in this
    fashion if there are family members or guardians present early in a child's
    life <i>who believe in those values</i> and who are <i>willing to spend the time to
    pass them on</i>.</p>
    <p>Other individuals, groups, and social institutions participate in the socialization of a culture's
    youth such as schools, peer groups, mass media, and faith institutions. But the
    family is the first and primary socializing agent. Terence P. Thornberry <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Thornberry1998">1998</a>)</font>,

    <p>Many gang youths come from dysfunctional families. Among the dysfunctional
    traits are child abuse, spouse abuse, substance
    abuse and addiction, parental gang membership, the absence of one or both
    parents, internal family strife, and poorly blended families (a family made
    up of two adults, each with children from relationships other than the
    current one). If
    a child is raised in a family in which the parents are themselves
    gang members, there is little hope the child will escape being socialized
    into a gang and adopt the values of its members.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Family problems and parenting difficulties can increase
    the risk of kids joining gangs. Many kids who join gangs come from
    middle-class families with two biological parents at home. However, many of

    gang what they are not getting (or will not accept) from their

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Fatherlessness in America is at historically high
      levels. Four out of 10 children - an estimated 24 million - do not have
      their fathers present in their homes. Research shows that children from
      father-absent homes are more likely to do poorly in school or drop out;
      suffer from lower levels of self-esteem; get involved with drugs, alcohol

    <p>Those who seldom or never experience unconditional love seem
    bound to seek it out or face a life of self-doubt. A visit to the Psychology or Self-Development section of
    an American book store should provide sufficient evidence of the seemingly overwhelming desire
    of people to be loved unconditionally, accepted, and to feel as though they are wanted.</p>

    <p>As has been noted in much of the literature on gangs, many of their
    members come from single parent homes in which the mother is the only
    parent present. As we have learned, in families where the father is absent 
    there may be no positive adult male role model for a young male child to 
    emulate. </p>
        <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">'The gang is a product of the broken home' was a popular
      saying among those who worked with gangs in the 1950's. Research during
      and after this period appeared to grant considerable support to this
      belief, although the language was altered somewhat to fit the terminology
      of the times. The research suggested a causal link between youth gangs and
      males reared in fatherless households.&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2">
      </font>
      <p><b><font size="2">The argument, in brief, was that <i>the absence of a stable male role
      model in many low-income households created identity problems for males
      and that the gangs</i>, with their emphasis on tough masculinity, male
      bonding, and macho values, in essence <i>took the place of fathers in
      providing a model of male identity for boys raised primarily by women</i>.
      Gang membership played a vital role in learning and practicing the
      characteristics and attitudes of male adulthood.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Insofar as the proposed link between gangs and fatherless families is
      valid, one would expect that communities with gangs would have more
      female-headed households than other communities and that an increase in
      the number of female-headed households would lead to an increase in the
      number of gangs. Available data support
      both assumptions.</font></b>
      <p><b><font size="2">Between 1970 and 1995, the population of gang cities in the United
      States increased from 21 percent to 50 percent of the city population.
      Statistics for the periods from 1970 through 1993 and 1970 through 1990
      show that the number of households with children under 18 living with
      'mother only' increased from 11 percent to 23 percent for the general
      population and from 30 percent to 54 percent for African
      Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">A substantial majority of the African American households were located
      in the inner-city areas where gangs traditionally have been found. While the increase in the number of children raised in female-headed
      households is smaller than the increase in gang-city populations, both the
      direction and general magnitude of the changes are similar. The increase
      in female-headed households would thus appear to be related to the
      increase in gangs. </font></b><font size="1"> (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>,

    <p>A gang can be a functional alternative to having a family. It may provide
    its members with a sense of belonging, affection, mutual support, and
    association. Among the differences between a family and gang, however, are the gang's possible initiation
    requirements, the expectation that its members will violate the law and conceal the
    criminality of fellow members, conditional love/caring, and the need
    to present a certain bravado which precludes being vulnerable and opening
    one self up for examination and guidance. Being threatened with
    punishment or murder for leaving the gang also differentiates gangs from a
    family.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>Youths often feel that
      gangs can protect them and keep them safe within the neighborhood, even
      when lacking parental support for the decision. When children are not
      monitored or supported by their parents (especially in single-parent households),
      gang membership becomes more attractive to youth. Joining a gang,
      therefore, seems to be one mechanism for an adolescent to find both family
      fulfillment and protection. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Reiboldt2001">Reiboldt</a>,

    <p>&quot;Gangsters often claim that the gang is organized for protection and

    than a reality.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Yablonsky1997">Yablonsky</a>,

    and the consequences of joining which may follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p> In
    some cases the gang is merely looking for additional members in order to boost its
    reputation as the biggest and most powerful in the neighborhood. They
    sometimes have little
    regard for the welfare of their members. Some gangs seek new members with
    the expectation that the new members will carry out the least desirable or most dangerous chores of the gang
    (i.e.,
    transporting illegal drugs, killing people, conducting drive-by-shootings, holding the weapons).</p>

    <p> When used
    appropriately, discipline reinforces compliance with family expectations.
    When not used, or used inappropriately, it results in neglect or abuse of a
    child. Excessive discipline (to the point of abuse),
    inconsistent discipline (sometimes the result of the discipliner's substance
    abuse, incompetence, or absence from the home), or lack of discipline (possibly neglect,
    the most common form of child abuse) encourage the onset of misbehaving and
    set into motion a cycle of abuse that may drive a child from the
    family home. It drives some children to form gangs and others to join them.</p>
