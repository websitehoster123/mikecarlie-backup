    <p>One of the goals I wanted to accomplish with <i>Into the Abyss </i>was to encourage readers to think
    more about why gangs form than about why some youths join them.
    Removing the need to join a gang represents a more significant step toward
    reducing gang activity and youth violence than focusing on why certain individuals
    join gangs.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
    Removing the <i> need</i> for gangs reduces the likelihood of anyone joining them.
    That's why I opened this part of the book on <i><a href="../../gangs/whyform/why_gangs_form.htm">Why Gangs Form</a></i> with a quote from Randy Martin in which he wrote
    &quot;... the subculture allows the individual to derive
      psychological benefits of recognition and respect. Consequently, the
      member of the subculture gains in self-esteem and in social status.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Martin1990">Martin</a>,
      et al., 1990, pp. 246-247)</font> For our purpose, the subculture is the gang.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p> Gangs form because they fulfill unmet needs
    for their members. Many of the those needs were identified by
    Maslow as discussed in the <i><a href="../../gangs/whyform/why_gangs_form.htm#Maslow">Introduction</a></i>.
    They included the <b>lower level needs</b>:

    <p>Gangs serve a purpose. They are functional. Their members &quot;derive
      psychological benefits of recognition and respect&quot; and gain in &quot;self-esteem
    and in social status&quot; as a consequence of being a member of a gang. <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Martin1990">ibid</a>)&nbsp;</font>
    This thread of functionality, or the satisfying of unmet needs, is woven through
    all the explanations for the formation of gangs identified in <i><a href="../../gangs/whyform/why_gangs_form.htm">Why
    Gangs Form</a></i>.
    </p>

    <p>While racial and ethnic discrimination rank high on my list of reasons for
    gang formation, many of the explanations we explored speak to problems
    arising from
    various social institutions (i.e., family, school, faith, commerce, criminal
    justice). The presence
    of gangs suggests one or more of the social institutions in
    the neighborhood in which the gang members live may have failed to do what
    they were supposed to do.&nbsp;

            about speeding ... it's like a man do. The second time we
            have to raise it to another level and someone gets hurt.&quot; In this case the gang is functioning as

            heard of gangs providing a neighborhood law enforcement function as several of them told me

            patrol. These neighborhoods are referred to as &quot;Dead Zones&quot;
            and are found in several large inner-city areas across the
            country. Even emergency services (ambulance and fire) are

    <p>While writing this book, one of my colleagues sent me an email in which he
    asked if there was a way in which I could link some of the causes of gang
    formation together. He wrote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>I've been thinking about your list of causes for gang
      formation and the  combinations one could make of them. Can you think
      of clusters of causes, that is, causal factors that tend to go together?
      If you can, perhaps you could identify a small number of clusters or
      nexuses of causes. If you could, you'll
      help your reader think accurately about the causality of gang
      formation. </b></font><font size="1">(Jeff Nash, October, 2001, email)</font><font size="2">

    </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>It was a wonderful question. I don't know if it's a personal bias or if
    it reflects the reality of the situation, or both, but after a year in the
    field studying the gang phenomenon several things became obvious to me:

    <p>I believe connections can be made between discrimination and many of the causes of gang formation.
    Reducing racial and ethnic discrimination will take us far
    in breaking the chain of causality which results in gang
    formation as well as substance abuse, child abuse, and so much else that is
    negative about our culture and the subculture of poverty, misunderstanding,
    and hatred it has fostered. </p>
	<p>An example of the compounding effect of a variety of causes of gang 
	formation may be found in the work of Barbara Mendenhall. Mendenhall 
	conducted a study of the Navajo Nation in the United States in order to 
	determine why youth gangs were appearing on the Nation's reservation.<font size="1"> 
	(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Mendenhall2004">Mendenhall</a>, 
	2004)</font> Among the most significant of her findings were the impact of 
	off-reservation influences upon Navajo youth. &quot;Apparently, when families who 
	have moved to nearby towns and cities return to their reservations, some of 
	their children transport a knowledge and a set of experiences derived from 
	having been involved in youth gangs in these more urbanized settings. Here, 
	one sees a very compelling argument for an &quot;importation effect&quot; as to why 
	gang form on reservations. <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Mendenhall2004">Mendenhall</a>, 
	2004, p. 2-3)</font></p>
	<p>Another factor leading to the formation of gangs on the Navajo 
	reservation is cluster housing.<font size="1"> (<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Mendenhall2004">Mendenhall</a>, 
	2004, p. 7-8)</font> During and after the 1970s, cluster housing was built 
	in various communities on the reservation. As Mendenhall found,</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Historically, dispersed home sites have been the 
		foundation for maintaining the core of Navajo culture even while 
		participating in ongoing culture change. This is the setting where 
		Navajo families reside with or near extended relatives, sharing 
		resources, participating and sharing in traditional pastoral and 
		agricultural subsistence activities, and having access to traditional 
		hogans to hold ceremonies and continue day-to-day practice of 
		traditional cultural beliefs and values. </b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>These locales are where children are successfully 
		socialized to be independent and self-reliant in the enveloping cocoon 
		of an extended family where they also learn the importance of 
		reciprocity and establish deep spiritual connection to family land. This 
		is the sociocultural setting in which Navajo children learn that they 
		matter to their community. In contrast, single-family, densely populated 
		cluster housing neighborhoods offer none of these critical, supportive 
		components of Navajo tradition. Living in cluster housing frequently 
		isolates families from the support and shared resources of extended 
		relatives. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Mendenhall2004">Mendenhall</a>, 
		2004, p. 7-8)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>In addition to the impact of outside (urban, non-reservation) influences, 
	we find in this scenario that changes in housing and losses of traditional 
	culture compound the problem. In addition, Mendenhall found that poverty, 
	substance abuse, family dysfunction, alienated Navajo youth, high rates of 
	geographic mobility (between the reservation and metropolitan areas) impact 
	Navajo and, in some instances, find them adopting a &quot;'gangsta' 
	identity.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Mendenhall2004">Mendenhall</a>,

 Why (Some) Youths
    Join</font></b></p>

    <p>As I have noted previously, my own preference is to focus on the reasons for gang formation in hopes
    that attention and effort will be paid to reducing those forces. Turning off
    the <a href="../../../Orientation/perspective.htm#Spigot"> spigot</a> is more
    effective in reducing gang activity and youth violence in the long term than
    is endlessly studying and attempting to clean up the spill.</p>
    <p>There are others, however, who are more interested in why some youths join gangs and,
    for those folks, there's a substantial body of literature to explore. The
    following is an excerpt from James C. Howell's <i>Youth Gangs: An Overview</i>
    <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell1998">1998</a>)
    </font>in which he refers to several timely and important studies on why some
    youths join gangs. I've included links to the bibliography for each of the
    works cited in Howell's work if you'd like to explore their findings in
    greater detail.</p>

    <p>We now have an idea of what a gang is, what a gang member is, the
    demographic composition of gangs, what kinds of gangs there are, what their
    culture is like, how they are structured, and why they form. But where does
    one find a gang? That's our next topic.</p>
