    community values and professional expertise to be inappropriate and

    <p>A country in which nearly 12 out of every 1,000 children are confirmed as
    maltreated has a problem, and we're not alone. Other cultures have
    similar difficulties, China among them. In a recent study conducted in Hong
    Kong researchers found, &quot;When compared to U.S. families,
    Chinese families showed ... much higher rates of severe violence toward
    children (461 versus 110 per 1,000 children). Children aged 3-6 years were
    the most vulnerable victims, and female caregivers the most likely abusers
    in both U.S. and Chinese families.&quot;<font size="1"> (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#So-KumTang1998">So-Kum

    <p>Many gang members come from families in which they are neglected and
    where psychological, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse are found. Such
    abuse at a very early age has a particularly negative effect on a growing
    child. It leaves an indelible impression and often leads to the kind of
    anger and aggression we see in gang youth today. Does it mean every abused child will
    become a gang member?&nbsp;No. But these maltreated children will face
    challenges and will be more likely to suffer from low self-esteem, have trouble at
    school, and feel terrible about themselves and others.</p>

    year old female, minority, alternative school students found they</p>

    <p>When some of these children walk out the front door of their homes they find violence on the
    street as well as in their schools and on school playgrounds. For a six, seven, or eight year old child it is a terrifying
    universe and one over which he or she has little or no control. How does a child cope with this situation?</p>

	<p>If there is a loving, caring family, it may provide the security
    needed. But if the family is the source of the fear, or if it is a
    dysfunctional, abusive, neglectful family, the child may be left to fend
    for him- or herself. Failing any other source of safety, a gang can provide
    for the
    child's need for security. At least there's safety in numbers and in the reputation of the gang.</p>
    <p>We know some young females use
    gang members as a way of stopping abuse at home. Gangs may form as a result of young boys
    or girls feeling threatened by
    local thugs - sometimes gang members themselves - abusive parents, school
    teachers, police, and others. There's strength and security in numbers and
    plenty of anger and aggression to go around.</p>

    <p>Gangs may form to meet the basic human need for safety and security if
    safety and security are to be found nowhere else. There's no doubt in my mind that gangs
    can provide some of their members with a
    sense of security, although it may be conditional (one is protected as long as one follows
    the gang's rules or stays out of the way of exceptionally pathological gang
    members), or short-lived.</p>
    <p>The security they provide may be a byproduct of the gang's reputation thus preempting an assault by rival gang
    members and other people. It may also be direct and physical as when one or
    more other gang members come to the aid of a fellow member whose security is
    being threatened. A gang member's security is enhanced by a gang if its members offer resources needed for a member's legal defense,
    provide weapons for self-defense, and alibis when they are needed to avoid prosecution. Gangs may also provide economic
    security in terms of offering opportunities to make
    money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Abuse, fear, and a lack of security alone are insufficient as an explanation
    for the formation of gangs. Economic deprivation may assist in their
    development.</p>
