    <p>When I think of social discrimination and rejection as related to the
    formation of gangs I think of several things. People may be discriminated against because they &quot;aren't from here,&quot;
    &quot;they aren't like us,&quot; &quot;they don't believe what we
    believe, &quot;they look different,&quot; or for many other reasons. This
    includes discrimination against people who have recently immigrated from other nations as well as people
    who have migrated or moved within the United States.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><a name="immigranttradition"></a>One of the oldest, most insightful, and 
	useful explanations for the 
	formation of street gangs is called the &quot;immigrant tradition.&quot; Immigrants to 
	many countries face prejudice and discrimination upon arrival in the host 
	culture. The more mature adults may find a way to work through the prejudice 
	and discrimination they encounter. Some of their children, however, my turn 
	to other children like themselves who are encountering hatred from the host 
	culture's population. These groups of immigrant youths often morph into 
	street gangs - formed, primarily, for the protection of its own members.</p>
	<p>As noted by Howell and Egley<font size="1"> (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#HowellEgley2005">2005</a>)</font>, </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Changing demographics in some 
		small towns and rural areas may contribute to the emergence or 
		escalation of gang problems.&nbsp; This may be related to the immigration of 
		newly arrive racial or ethnic groups into an area.&nbsp; For example, 
		language barriers and being ostracized by the dominant population of 
		years at school and on the streets may lead excluded youths to band 
		together and coalesce into a permanent youth group and potentially come 
		to be recognized as a gang.</font></b></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Thorsten Sellin was a criminologist and introduced the field of 
	criminology to the concept of &quot;cultural conflict&quot; where in immigrants from 
	one nation to another often encounter conflict as do migrants from one part 
	of a county to another part of the same country. He called the first 
	&quot;primary conflict&quot; and the latter &quot;secondary conflict.&quot; In both situations, 
	it would not be surprising to find the migrants or immigrants forming 
	groups/gangs to protect themselves against the discrimination and hatred 
	expressed by those in the host culture.</p>
    <p>Prejudice - the pre-judgment and often negative stereotyping of others - often leads to discrimination - action taken against those about whom one is
    prejudiced. In this regard, I think of the prejudice expressed by some Caucasians against Hispanics, Asians, and
    African-Americans as well as the ill-will expressed among them all
    towards each other.</p>

    <p>Robert Park and Ernest Burgess, sociology faculty at the University of
    Chicago in the early third of the 20th century, developed a unique
    perspective on the urban environment called the ecological approach. An outgrowth of their work provides
    valuable insight into the nature
    of urban life today and its relationship to the formation of gangs.</p>
    <p>While Park suggested a given population of people may <i>dominate</i>
    (in population size) a given neighborhood. Over time &quot;new&quot; and ethnically- or
    racially different people may move into (<i>invade) </i>the neighborhood and
    gain dominance over the old population through a process of <i>succession</i>.
    The words in italics are those applied by Park and Burgess in their study of
    human ecology. They are also italicized in the following quote.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Robert Park and Ernest Burgess pioneered the
      ecological approach. The model was borrowed from the study of plant
      ecosystems. In nature, plants and animals seem to live together in mutual
      harmony and are ultimately interdependent. {Bees pollinate flowers
      producing seeds, etc.} Such mutual interdependence is called
      &quot;symbiosis.&quot; Park believed that cities might be symbiotic
      environments.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Park believed that the city was
      a super-organism ... that contained natural areas. Natural areas took many
      different forms, including (1) ethnic enclaves (2) activity related areas
      {e.g. business districts, shopping districts, manufacturing districts,
      residential areas, etc.}, (3) income groupings {e.g. ... middle class neighborhoods, ghettos,
      etc.}, and (4) physically separated
      areas {areas cut off from each other by rivers, lakes, railroad tracks,
      airports, etc.}.</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>While the concepts of symbiosis and natural areas
      might explain city life at any one point in time (a snapshot), alone they
      could not explain urban change, in particular, the patterns of growth,
      decay, and renewal which all cities appeared to follow. To explain this
      phenomenon Park borrowed another concept from plant ecology, <i> <font color="#FF0000">invasion</font></i>.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>While an ecosystem might remain in balance for a
      sustained period of time, the introduction of a new species might upset
      the old balance. [For example] In the early 20th century, English settlers
      introduced a breed of cactus into Australia that proceeded to grow
      everywhere and killed off a significant amount of the native vegetation.
      Park believed that a similar pattern occurred in cities.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>As the &quot;new&quot; (people) invaded an
      established natural area a struggle for dominance was precipitated. If the
      invasion was successful, the new became <i> <font color="#FF0000">dominant</font></i>
      and the process of <i> <font color="#FF0000">succession</font></i> was complete.
      The &quot;new&quot; might be a group of people (e.g. Polish immigrants
      replacing Irish) or urban development. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Greek1999">Greek</a>,
      1999, <a href="http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/week6.htm">page</a>,
      color highlight added for emphasis)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>They also observed that this process of dominance, invasion, and
    succession often resulted in conflict between
    the various groups moving into and out of the neighborhood. Viewing this process in the context of the
    gang phenomenon, some youths feel discriminated against due to their ethnicity, inability
    to speak a preferred language, race, ideology, or some other
    characteristic.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Most of these youths, it appears, have learned how to deal with this 
    situation without joining a gang or otherwise violating the law. They are 
    able to do so because neighborhood residents or institutions have 
    facilitated their integration or their family and friends have provided the 
    care and attention needed to help make the transition into mainstream
    society. They have been insulated against the negative consequences of
    discrimination.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b>Hagedorn's position
      regarding the etiology [cause] of Milwaukee's street gangs is that 'gang
      formation took place in a context of continuing crisis in race relations.'
      The implication for the present would be that those race and ethnic groups
      most subjected to racism and oppression (African-Americans, Latinos,
      American Indians, Asians, etc.) would be the most conspicuously
      represented in gang organization. Similarly, those cities experiencing
      heightened levels of racial conflict would likewise be those more likely
      to show the stronger emergence of a gang problem. </b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knox1994">Knox</a>,
      1994, p. 79)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There are youths, however, who are not so blessed. The
    neighborhoods and families in which they live have little to offer in the
    way of resources. They are forced to fend for themselves. Without acceptance from
    their family and neighborhood, they may form a gang in order to  shield
    themselves against the insults of invading populations and to gain acceptance from
    other gang members. The gang then provides a sense belonging.</p>

    <p>Sociologist Albert Cohen provides an insight into how gangs may form when
    integration into the larger society is blocked. He wrote &quot;If an individual finds assimilation into a larger and dominate [sic]
    culture problematic, he or she may search for alternate routes to the
    desired recognition and respect. Such a new quest is made easier if
    one associates with others who are experiencing similar rejection. As
    individuals experiencing similar stress congregate, new subcultures
    emerge.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Martin1990">Martin</a>,
    et al, 1990, pp. 245-246)</font> For some youth, the new subculture may be a
    gang.</p>

    <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#008000"><b>Why do girls join this

            Lawrence, a British intelligence specialist, he estimated there
            are between 30 and 40 distinctly different communities in the
            Greater London area with at least 100,000 people living in each. In
            one community there are approximately 140 different languages spoken
            in its population of 250,000 people. On the way to my
            interview with Phillip I took a picture of some neighborhood graffiti which read
            &quot;Somalians go back to your own country!&quot; As I was later to
            learn, the
            minority population presenting, in his view, &quot;the most problems

Amsterdam concerning Moroccans. He said there are parallels in London. The
older, more fundamental men (particularly Sikhs and Muslims) expect an allegiance from their youth.
The youth,
because they are more interested in entering the mainstream of British youth
culture,
are rejected by their elders. But they are also rejected by British culture for
a variety of reasons. They are then, like the Dutch Moroccan youths, living
in a limbo. A limbo or void which may nurture the formation of a gang.</font></b></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;The problem is,&quot; Phillip said, &quot;the
            [City] council decided to allow about 6,000 Somalians [to move in] and it
            was like setting off a bomb. The Sikhs [who are Hindu and dominate
            the neighborhood] were as happy to see the Somalians [who are
            Muslim] move in as were the white English who dominated the
            neighborhood before the Sikhs moved in. Now Sikh gangs have formed to attack Muslims with machetes, bats, chains and
            anything else they can get their hands on. We have gangs and gangs members here who wear colors just like your gangs in the USA.&quot;</font></b></p>

    <p>Immigration (the movement of people from one country to another) is only
    one half of the issue. The other half is migration (movement within a country or
    within a state or city). Migration may also result in difficulties with integration.</p>
    <p>Criminologist Thorsten Sellin referred to conflicts between host 
    (native) and
    immigrant populations as &quot;primary cultural conflict&quot; and conflicts
    between host and migrating populations as &quot;secondary cultural
    conflict.&quot;<font size="1">  (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Sellin1938">Sellin</a>,
    1938)</font>
    The conflicts, he believed, were based upon the cultural differences between
    the various populations - particularly their norms concerning personal
    conduct. Carried out in the 1920s, Sellin's research hints at a long history of
    understanding the causes of cultural conflict. We can apply his concepts to
    our discussion of why gangs form by viewing gangs as a
    mechanism for dealing with, or as an expression of, cultural conflict.</p>

    attacks. Gangs may form and become rapidly entrenched, first as defensive,

    <p>Ethnic and racial prejudice - which includes rejection of people due to their
    cultural heritage, religious beliefs, or race - are all bound together in
    creating a potential for youths to form gangs to protect themselves
    against the discriminators and to find acceptance among one another within
    their gang. Vigil tells us of the complexity of this situation when he
    refers to the &quot;double marginality&quot; experienced by youths from a
    foreign culture who are simultaneously rejected by the host culture and
    their home culture.<font size="1"> (<a href="../../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Vigil1988">Vigil</a>,
    1988, p. 14)</font></p>
    <p>Vigil's portrayal of discrimination against immigrant Hispanics in the
    United States illustrates the impact of discrimination on Hispanic youth and the
    resulting formation of gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">Many factors have played a role in the development and
    institutionalization of gangs. Among them are historical experiences
    stemming from racial discrimination and economic barriers that have
    detrimentally affected Mexican American families and their children.
    Particularly noteworthy in the context of large-scale and continuing
    immigration since the 1920s are where the newcomers settled, what jobs they
    filled, and how these beginnings affected other aspects of their lives.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Many immigrant parents lost control of their children
    during their initial struggle to adapt to urban American culture while still
    retaining some rural Mexican identity. Next, they too had to cope with
    economic hardships compounded by prejudice and discrimination. All too
    often, other institutions of social control (especially schools and police)
    were unable or unwilling to adequately address the needs of these children.</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Left to their own devices and the influence of older
      peers encountered in the streets, the youth formed gangs. Over the years,

    </blockquote>
      <p>Vigil's comments highlight the fact that a variety of factors - in this
      case  economic and ethnic discrimination - may lead to the formation of
      gangs. As noted <a href="../../gangs/whyform/why_gangs_form.htm#multi-causal">earlier</a>, the causes of gang formation are
      many and are often intertwined.</p>
    <p>Children are supposed to develop a feeling of acceptance and belonging from their family
    life at home. If they don't find it there, they may find it at school among
    their peers and school personnel. If they don't find it there, perhaps they
    will find it in their
    faith community. If not there, where?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A sense of belonging is, as Maslow instructed, a basic
    human need which must be met if the individual is to be healthy in the
    broadest sense. This basic human need for acceptance may result in a child rejecting his or her
    family - where they are not being
    accepted - and forming a group of similarly situated youth in order to find
    acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Acceptance into a gang sometimes means joining
    a group of youths from one's native culture (a country, for example) or
    subculture (i.e., African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans). Members share a common appearance, cultural beliefs, and language, as well as
    their frustrations stemming from discrimination and
    ill-fated attempts
    at integration into the host culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Within a gang, members find a place where they
    are accepted, wanted, and needed. Informal socializing,
    partying with one another, &quot;kickin' it,&quot; (simply spending time
    with one another), and defending one another against foes and rivals are characteristic of many
    gangs and they all produce feelings of belonging.</p>
    <p> The camaraderie I saw between
    gang members, however, was offset by the brutality they carry out upon
    one another. Initiation ceremonies which involve the brutalization of the initiate,
    and penalties for violating the rules of the gang were
    difficult to understand in the context of a gang being a loving, caring
    &quot;family.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
