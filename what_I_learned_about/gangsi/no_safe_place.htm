    <p>National and state data reveal areas in which high crime and other social
    problems overlap. For example, statistics indicate that persons with low
    incomes are at a higher risk of becoming crime victims. The KIDS COUNT in
    Missouri 1994 Report reveals an overlap between those counties with the
    highest juvenile crime rates and those with high rates of poverty. Gang
    activity, substance abuse, increased access to guns, and inadequate and
    unsafe schools also appear to be more prevalent in areas with high criminal
    activity.<br>

    </blockquote>
    <p>While criminal activity has been increasing among juveniles and adults
    alike, poverty is also at an all time high. Recent data from the Center on
    Budget and Policy Priorities (1993) illustrate that the gap between the poor
    and the wealthy is at its widest point in 25 years. In 1993, 39.3 million
    people were considered poor; 39.7 million had no health insurance. A recent
    report by the Children s Defense Fund warned that if present trends
    continue, 17 million American children will be living in poverty by the year
    2001. Though poverty is not by itself a predictor of community violence,
    data suggest that high-poverty areas frequently have unusually high levels
    of youth violence. Analysis of 1994 KIDS COUNT in Missouri data indicates
    that Mississippi and Pemiscot counties and St. Louis City have some of the
    highest levels of both poverty and youth crime.
    <p>Elijah Anderson, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania,
    believes that poor youngsters turn to violence as a remedy for
    powerlessness. Criminal activity often flourishes in environments that offer
    few resources or alternative activities for youth. When few job
    opportunities or role models exist, criminal activities can provide
    excitement, status, and financial gain.

    </blockquote>
    <p>According to a Citizens Guide to Street Gangs distributed by the St.
    Louis County Police, 90% of all male gang members have been arrested by age
    18. Ninety-five percent will not finish high school, and 60% are dead or in
    prison by age 20. The movement of gang activity into a town or neighborhood
    is often followed by an increase in violent crime.
    <p>What is the reward gang behavior brings to juveniles? In the absence of
    academic and career opportunities, gang membership can provide an identity
    and a purpose. Gangs also offer protection, camaraderie, and excitement to
    young people. According to the St. Louis County Police, &quot;Gangs are ego
    support systems; they are viewed by kids as launch pads to becoming big
    shots.&quot;

  <blockquote>
    <p>Gang activity accounts for only part of youth crime, however, and it is
    certainly not the only peer influence that encourages violence. Mass media
    television, radio, publications, and films glorify violence. In the U.S.,
    children watch an average of 28 hours of T.V. weekly. Five violent acts per
    hour are observable in prime-time programming. Twenty five violent acts per
    hour are observable in cartoons (Johnston, 1993). While it is true that
    television violence and aggressive behavior correlate (Center for Media and
    Values, 1993), one can also argue that T.V., music, gangsta rap, and movie
    content all mirror the society in which they are created. Artists say that
    they produce what others are willing to buy. Unfortunately, violence sells
    well.

    <p>Drug and alcohol abuse can also lead to increased youth violence. When
    students from 32,000 middle and high schools across the country were
    evaluated, those using drugs were &quot;more than twice as likely to get
    into physical fights, three times more likely to be truant from school, and
    four times more likely to commit vandalism&quot; (Safe 2000 Community
    Partnership, 1994). Drugs and alcohol contribute to an unsafe environment
    for juveniles and increased violence among juveniles.

    <p>It is illegal for juveniles to purchase firearms. However, many children
    have access to firearms, and they carry and use these weapons regularly.
    Many children and families express fears regarding the increased violence in
    schools and communities. This fear of violence itself increases rates of gun
    ownership, as youths and adults seek to defend their own safety.
    <p>Unfortunately, an increased number of guns often leads to unintentional
    shootings as well as criminal violence. Nowhere is injury and death by
    gunfire more observable than in our nation's population of young people.<br>

    <p>Children living in high-poverty areas frequently attend schools that are
    under-funded and ill-equipped to meet their educational and social needs.
    Increasingly, schools are asked to meet a variety of demands in these
    communities when often they can barely provide the basics of education. As a
    result, many young people leave school before graduation because they see no
    connection between academic effort and future success. Citizens for Missouri
    s Children has found a strong relationship between rates of poverty and low
    high school completion rates in Missouri counties.

    <p>As if underfunded and ill-equipped facilities were not enough of an

    <p>Many schools are taking an active role in reducing violence within their
    buildings and playgrounds and, ultimately, in their communities. Conflict
    resolution and peer mediation are included in the curriculum in a number of
    school districts. Schools have the advantage of being both a place in which
    skills can be taught and a controlled environment in which those skills can
    be practiced. Another approach to violence reduction in schools is the
    &quot;fight-free&quot; school concept. High expectations, school pride, and
    recognition of success motivate students to refrain from fighting. By giving
    visible and vocal messages that fighting is not acceptable and by praising
    students success in achieving fight-free school days, the social norm is
    shaped so that fighting is not socially acceptable behavior.
    <p>Although these skills are most often taught in middle and high schools,
    there is a growing recognition that teaching violence prevention to very
    young children is of critical importance. The Nursery Foundation, a child
    care provider in St. Louis that has been an anchor for the neighborhood
    since its founding in 1947, has been in the vanguard of teaching children to
    change the attitudes and behaviors which contribute to violence. Children
    ages 3-6 are taught empathy (how to identify and predict the feelings of
    others), skills in problem solving and resolving conflict without fighting,
    and ways to reduce their stress and channel angry feelings in positive ways.
    The Nursery Foundation utilizes the &quot;Second Step Violence Prevention
    Curriculum&quot; in their work with children.
    <p>Issues of crime and violence as they relate to juveniles are extremely
    complex. Many factors correlate with high crime rates, including poverty,
    negative peer culture, drug and alcohol abuse, ready access to guns, and
    poor educational opportunity. Successful prevention must take these
    complexities into account.
