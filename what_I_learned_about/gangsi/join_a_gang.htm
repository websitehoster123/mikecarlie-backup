    <p align="left">An organization that hopes to exist over time must either
    create or recruit new members or it will perish.  Established gang members recruit for new gang members in
    schools, on the street, while confined in detention, in fast food
    restaurants and their parking lots, at parties, in jail or prison, at concerts and
    family get-togethers (many recruits are the little brothers and sisters of
    established gang members), and anywhere else they may find potential
    members.</p>

            The gang unit officer said gang membership is sometimes determined
            by the school the youths attend. It is at the school that recruiting
            takes place. He also noted that this sometimes causes problems
            because, in the same neighborhood, there may be kids attending
            different schools. This means that rivalry between gangs happens
            simply because of attendance at different schools and it brings
            rivals into contact with one another when they go home after school.</font></b></p>

    an initiation ceremony to show the gang's members they &quot;have
    what it takes.&quot; Well, at least that's what I thought. It's not true. Some gangs have initiation ceremonies, others do
    not. Some gangs require potential members go through
    initiation ceremonies while others require only certain people go through them
    while letting others join the gang without ceremony.</p>
    <p align="left"><a name="Blessed"></a>Among those who may avoid an initiation
    ceremony are people who are &quot;<b>blessed in</b>&quot; to a gang. Those 
    who are blessed-in to a gang have older brothers,
    fathers, mothers, or other relatives who were already in the gang.&nbsp;There 
    are other ways to enter a gang - ways to
    be tested prior to entrance, a &quot;trial by ordeal,&quot; as it used to
    be called. The following are some of the initiation rites I learned about:</p>

    fulfills a pragmatic need to screen potential new members for fighting 
    skills and courage valued by the gang, as well as some of the psychological 
    needs of youth attempting to cope with adolescent age and gender role 
    identity crises. Most gang members are initiated at about age 12 or 13 and,

    beating inflicted depends both on the initiate's prior standing with the
    gang (those who grew up with gang members or who have relatives in the gang

	Completing the initiation rite successfully meant that he would be able to 
	wear the colors of the gang, have the gang tattoo put on his body, learn the 
	rules of the gang, and more.</p>
	<p align="left">One night, as Don was gathered with the older gang members, 
	he was told it was time for him to be initiated, if that was what he wanted. 
	&quot;I wanted it badly,&quot; Don told me. Then he said, &quot;They wrote down the 
	addresses of rival gang leaders - one address on each piece of paper. Then 
	they put the pieces of paper in a bowl and asked me to draw out one piece. 
	They told me that the address I had to do a drive-by on.&quot;</p>
	<p align="left">Three cars were used for the initiation by 
	drive-by-shooting. The lead and rear cars were packed with senior gang 
	members, all of them armed except the driver. They were there to &quot;protect my 
	back,&quot; Don said. &quot;Just in case anyone in the house or nearby started 
	shooting back!&quot;</p>
	<p align="left">The middle car was driven by an older gang member and Don 
	was the only person in the back seat. He said &quot;We drove down the street real 
	slow and, when we got in front of the target - you know, the house, I 
	unloaded my Glock.&quot; I think it had 17 or 23 rounds of 40 caliber bullets. He 
	said &quot;I was scared to death, but I did it, and I became a member of the 
	gang.&quot;</p>
	<p align="left">I asked Don how he felt about what he did and if he hit 
	anyone. He replied &quot;I don't feel real good about it, and I didn't feel too 
	good about it back then. I didn't look back and I didn't read the paper or 
	listen to radio or watch TV for a while. I didn't want to know if I hurt 
	anyone.&quot;</p>
	<p align="left">Don is now 25 years old, no longer active in the gang, and 
	building a legitimate career as a plumber. A local plumber, at the urging of 
	Don's parole officer, offered him an apprenticeship in is company.</p>
	<p align="left">Don worked hard and gained the trust of the local plumber 
	and his clients. Now the plumber is helping Don build his own plumbing 
	company and, for the past two years, things have been going well. Don is no 
	longer violating the law, he no long associates with his fellow gang members 
	(although he admits he is proud of the fact that he is still a member), and 
	he satisfactorily completed his parole a month prior to our interview.</p>

    In</font></b></p>
    <p>According to Moore and Hagedorn,&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2"> &quot;Sex object&quot; was one of the
    early stereotypes of female gang members, and the interest in the sex lives
    of female gang members still persists. Early reports about the easy
    sexual availability of female gang members came almost exclusively from male
    gang members</font><font size="1"> </font></b><font size="1"> (e.g., 
	<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#ShortStrodtbeck1965">Short and
    Strodtbeck</a>, 1965).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Even some recent reports present similar male perceptions as fact, with
    no attempt at verification </font> </b><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Sanchez1991">Sanchez-Jankowski</a>, 1991).&nbsp;<b>
      </b></font><b><font size="2">However, male gang members may be indulging their own fantasies.
      In a
    recent study, male gang members told researchers that group sex was an
    initiation ritual for female gang members, but female gang members dismissed
    the idea as ludicrous </font></b><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#DeckerWinkle1996">Decker and Van
    Winkle</a>, 1996).&quot; (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FemaleGangs">Moore
      and Hagedorn</a>, 2001, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/jjbul2001_3_3/page3.html">scroll
      down to &quot;Sex: Stereotyping and Victimization</a>)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
      <p>I asked several gang members how they would feel if their little
      brothers or sisters were to join a gang. While some expected this
      would happen and had no problem with it, most felt
      differently. One O.G.'s response was representative of most gang members I interviewed.
      He said &quot;I'd beat their asses if they
      joined! I been there and I don't want them to have to go through
      what I've had to go through.&quot;</p>
    <p>Once someone has been accepted as a member of a gang he or she is
    expected to become involved in criminal activity. By definition, gangs are
    groups of people who support one another in the commission of delinquent and
    criminal acts, and that is our next subject.&nbsp;</p>
