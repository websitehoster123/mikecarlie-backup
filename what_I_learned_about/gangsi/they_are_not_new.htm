    people, in itself, is nothing new. Indeed, youth gangs have been a major
    part of the urban cultural landscape since at least the 1830s, when Charles

    <p>Gangs have been around much longer than that. For example, &quot;The word <i>thug</i> dates back to India in the year 1200 A.D. and refers
    to a gang of criminals (Thugz) that roamed the country, pillaging towns
    along their path. These Thugz had their own symbols, hand signs,
    rituals, and slang.&nbsp;In the United States, we grew up with tales of our
    own form of thugs like pirates and gangsters, therefore, gangs, undoubtedly,
    are not a new concept.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Savelli2001">Savelli</a>,

    <p>One of my colleagues, a native of Goa, India,

    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">Youth gangs have existed in Western and Eastern societies for
    centuries. As early as the 1600's, London was 'terrorized by a series of
    organized gangs calling themselves the Mims, Hectors, Bugles, Dead Boys ... who found amusement in breaking windows, demolishing taverns, [and] assaulting
    the watch ... The gangs also fought pitched battles among themselves
    dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.</font></b><font size="1">

    <p>The wearing of <i>colors</i> is not new, as Pearson noted above, nor is
    the wearing of gang-related garb. &quot;In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, English gangs wore
    belts and metal pins with designs of serpents, hearts pierced with arrows,
    animals, and stars.&quot; <font size="1">(Source: <a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#YouthGangs1991">Spergel</a>,

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Throughout the 1800s, Americans
      were fascinated by gangs and gang members. The James Gang, Billy the
      Kid, and other outlaws ruled the Wild West according to legend. As
      the late 1800s roared in, the new generation of gangs and gang members was
      created by the new immigrants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b> Irish gangs like the Whyos, Dead
      Rabbits, and Plug Uglies, and Jewish gangs like the Monk Eastman Gang
      terrorized New York City streets. The most notorious gang during
      this era formed in New York City during the late 1890s and early 1900s. This gang, called the Five Points Gang because its home turf, was situated
      in the Five Points (Bowery) section of lower Manhattan, would change the
      mold of the American outlaw.</b></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>The Five Points Gang, led by Italian
      immigrant Paolo Antonini Vaccarelli, also known as Paul Kelly, and his
      second in command, Johnny Torrio, was the most significant street gang to
      form in the United States to this point. Johnny Torrio, who became a
      significant member of the Sicilian Mafia (La Cosa Nostra), recruited
      street hoodlums from across New York City to the Five Points Gang. Five Points Gang became the 'major league' to many young
      street gangsters, and a farm club for the Mafia.&nbsp;</b></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b> The most notorious
      recruit into the Five Points Gang was a teenaged boy of Italian descent
      who was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in 1899 to immigrant parents. His name was Alphonse Capone, but he was better known on the streets as 'Scarface.'&nbsp; He became a member of the James Street Gang,
      which was a minor league, of sorts, to the Five Pointers. One of
      Capone's childhood friends, and a fellow member of the Five Points Gang,
      was another street thug named Lucky Luciano.</b></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>In 1919, while being sought by
      authorities in connection with a mob-related murder in New York, Al 'Scarface'
      Capone moved to Chicago when summoned by Johnny Torrio, who needed his
      assistance in maintaining control of Chicago mob territories. Capone
      eventually became the most violent and prolific gangster in Chicago, if
      not the United States, of that era. The 'Al Capone' style
      of gangster has molded the American gang experience, and continues to
      influence America's street gangs.</b></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>As street gangs, influenced by mobsters
      such as Capone, flourished during the 1920s and 30s, gangs became a symbol
      of lower income neighborhoods and ethnic ghettos. America's new
      immigrant communities and ghetto neighborhoods saw their youth forming
      gangs. African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics made up the majority
      of street gangs that sociologists studied during this period, but the
      majority of large American cities were experiencing street gangs to some
      degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2"> During the early 1900s, Mexican street gangs formed in the
      western U.S., and during the 1940s and 1950s, gangs like the Latin Kings
      and Vice Lords were formed in Chicago. During the 1960s, street
      gangs, with names like the Savage Skulls, La Familia, and Savage Nomads,
      formed in New York City.&quot; </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Savelli2001">Savelli</a>,

    <p align="left">While preparing to speak to a regional gathering of law 
	enforcement commanders about gangs I found a set of 1950 encyclopedias in 
	the hotel's library. Curious as to what the authors would have said about 
	gangs in 1955, I pulled down the &quot;G&quot; volume and this is what I found. </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Gang</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">A gang is a group of persons who 
		join together and work toward the same goal. The word has been used for 
		such groups as work gangs on railroads or roads, but in recent times it 
		has come to mean persons grouped together for criminal purposes.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">During the early days of the West 
		in the United States, the forces of law and order were still very weak. Cattle thieves and other criminals who had been outlawed by the people 
		of the towns and ranches would join together in outlaw gangs. These 
		outlaw gangs often became so strong that they could rob and steal at 
		will and fight off officers of the law.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Many years later, in the 1920s, 
		the Prohibition Era developed a new kind of gang. This was the period 
		in which it was a crime to make, sell, or transport alcoholic liquors in 
		the United States. Many people wanted to buy liquor anyway, and the 
		demand for it made a wonderful opportunity for criminals. The breaking 
		of the law started with men called “bootleggers,” who made and sold 
		liquor in a small way. Then bigger criminals went into the liquor 
		business. They formed gangs, and the members of the gangs were called 
		gangsters. They smuggled liquor from countries where it could be bought 
		legally and sold it in the United States.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Bootlegging was such a profitable 
		criminal business that there was great competition among the different 
		gangs, and gag wars began. A great wave of murder swept over the 
		country, with gangsters being found dead nearly every day. The 
		gangsters used not only pistols but also machine guns and bombs. The 
		expression “take someone for a ride” meant to drive a person out to a 
		lonely spot and kill him, and this often happened. In 1933 the 
		Prohibition law was repealed, but there was no way of repealing the 
		gangs.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">When the liquor business was 
		ended the gangsters spread to many other businesses.&nbsp; They started 
		“protection racket,” which forced small businessmen to pay them a 
		certain amount of money by threatening to ruin their businesses or even 
		kill the owners. They smuggled many things into the country, especially 
		narcotic drugs.&nbsp; Many gang activities were turned into organized 
		businesses.&nbsp; Often the leaders of the gangs seemed to have close ties 
		with the political organizations of the city or state in which they 
		operated, so that it was very difficult to do anything to stop their 
		crimes. At last the United States government stepped in, and government 
		agents such as the “G-men” (agents of the Federal Bureau of 
		Investigation of the Department of Justice”, and agents of the Treasury 
		Department, have been very successful in breaking up the gangs and 
		sending their leaders to prison.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Juvenile Gangs&nbsp;</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Another kind of gang is the one 
		formed by children and young people.&nbsp; Many juvenile gangs are intended 
		only for fun and social activities. The gang is a way of finding 
		adventure, and it can develop loyalty and other good traits in it 
		members.&nbsp; This kind of gang is really a sort of club.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">But some juvenile gangs turn into 
		the same sort of bad group that the grown-up gangsters belong to. These 
		young gangsters have their gang wars, and these wars often lead to 
		serious injury and death. The gang members fight with stolen guns and 
		homemade weapons and knives. They steal automobiles and use them for 
		wild rides about the city or countryside, often causing accidents that 
		injure or kill other persons.&nbsp; Sometimes they organize bigger thefts 
		from stores and find themselves in serious trouble.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Most of these juvenile gangsters 
		come from poor or unhappy homes, and their chief trouble is lack of love 
		and understanding and proper training. The best way to prevent the 
		crime that grows out of juvenile gangs is to provide good neighborhood 
		centers for them, where they can have fun in useful and healthful ways. The principal thing such young gangsters need is some way to make use of 
		their normal desire for a feeling of achievement and a feeling of being 
		wanted and needed.&nbsp; (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Illustrated">Source</a>) </font></b></p>

	<p align="left">It's fascinating to read about how the gang phenomenon was 
	viewed in 1955 in light of the nature of gangs in the 21st century. The 
	distinction suggested between &quot;gangs&quot; and &quot;juvenile gangs&quot; is one that is 
	blurred today - more a continuum from one to the other than a distinct 
	separation. </p>
	<p align="left">The reference to having or developing &quot;good traits&quot; is, as 
	we know about some gangs and their members today, absurd. And the drug 
	around which much of their social and criminal activity takes place has 
	simply changed from alcohol to other controlled substances thanks, once 
	again, to attempts to legislate morality.</p>
	<p align="left">Still, the suggestion that there is a need for &quot;neighborhood 
	centers ... where they can have fun in useful and healthful ways&quot; still 
	applies.</p>
	<p align="left">The fact that gangs have existed for many centuries suggests they may exist far into the future. Efforts to eradicate them may be foolhardy,
    although the level of their activity, in amount and kind, may be reduced
    through effective prevention, intervention, and suppression efforts. We will
    explore these approaches later in <i>Solutions</i>. For now, let's take a
    look at the kinds of gangs there are and the names by which they are 
    identified.</p>
