    <p>The last national survey which collected data on the age of gang members
    was conducted in 1998. Based upon the findings of that survey we know that <b>&quot;Fifty percent of gang members in 1999 were ages 18 to
    24, an increase from 46 percent in 1998 and 37 percent in 1996</b> (see Figure 4

    <p align="left">The oldest gang member I interviewed was 61 years of
          age. Sixty and seventy year old gang members may not be
    the norm but gang members who are in their twenties and thirties are no
    longer uncommon. While twenty or thirty years ago a gang member may have
    been able to leave a gang in their teens or early twenties and enter
    legitimate employment, that transition is not as easily made
    today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">The reason for this, in part, may be attributed to the
            inability of adolescent gang members to find employment sufficient
            to take them out of the gang life. Chart 1 (below) illustrates that as
            high school graduation rates decrease and the lowest level of
    competency required by the business sector increases, gang
    members are cast into a limbo in which they are displaced from employment well beyond their youth.
    The alternative for some is to remain in the gang.<p>&nbsp;

    <p align="left">Other explanations for the aging of gang members include the ability of some
    to maintain a sufficient livelihood from their gang-related or other criminal activities and for others to live at
    subsistence levels from welfare, alms, someone else's earnings, or other sources of income.
          <p align="left">As to the 11% of gang members who were under 15 years
          of age in 1998 (see Figure 4 above), we may note that &quot;Offenders under age 15 represent the
          leading edge of the juvenile crime problem, and their numbers have
          been growing.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Butts1997">Butts
          and Snyder</a>, 1997, p. 1) </font>In addition, &quot;Offenders age 12 or

<p align="left">Data on the social class of gang members is notoriously absent
from the literature. There are references, to be sure, to the poverty from which
many gang members come but there is precious little data on their socio-economic
status (income, education, and occupation of the parents). Arlen Egley reported the following findings in his most recent
survey of gangs in the United States.</p>
    <blockquote>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2">In a question new to the 1999 survey,
respondents were asked to identify gang members by social class. Fifty percent
of gang members were reported as underclass, followed by working class (35
percent), middle class (12 percent), and upper middle class (3 percent).</font></b><font size="2"><b>
</b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Egley2000">Egley</a>,
    2000, page 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Poverty has become so ingrained in American society that a
    relatively new class has emerged over the past several decades. It is
    referred to as the &quot;underclass&quot; and consists of people who have
    lived in poverty for generations. It is the class below the lower-class and
    the one from which, according to Egley's research, one-half of gang members
    emerge.</p>
    <p align="left">That 15% of gang members may be from the middle- and
    upper-middle class is supported by my observations in the field and suggests
    probation/parole and police officers are correct when they say &quot;Gang
    members can be found in all neighborhoods, rich or poor.&quot; We should note,
    however, Egley does not categorize any gang members as being upper-class.
    There may be gang members who come from wealthy families, but they were not
    represented in the data Egley collected.</p>
    <p align="left">We now turn our attention to the gender profile of American
    gangs.</p>
