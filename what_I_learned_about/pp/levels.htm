      <p>I started teaching in 1970. Back then, when I taught about what
    probation and parole officers do, I was referring to a job in which officers
    counseled their clients, helped them find work, and, in many other ways,
      directly intervened in their lives. This situation has changed
    radically over the years as the size of caseloads has increased.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Statements such as &quot;The shortage of probation officers has
      handicapped the Probation Department's ability to protect the public&quot;
      <font size="1">(<a href="http://antonovich.co.la.ca.us/">The
      Antonovich Reports, 1997</a>, not found on the web as of December 2005)</font>
      may be heard in jurisdictions across the United States and in other
      countries. The reasons for this shortage include declining state budgets,
      the undesirable salaries offered probation/parole officers, and the
      excessive caseloads which are being assigned to them.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Courts with juvenile jurisdiction handled nearly 1.8
    million delinquency cases in 1998. Probation supervision was the most severe
    disposition in about 38% (665,500) of all delinquency cases. The number of
    cases placed on probation grew 56% between 1989 and 1998.</b> </font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Black2001">Black</a>,

      <p><a name="broker"></a>Today, probation and parole officers, particularly those in larger urban
    areas, are more accurately referred to as &quot;brokers of
    services.&quot; They are situated between their clients and the
    services available in the community.</p>
      <p><a name="services"></a> Depending upon the community, the
      services may include individual and family counseling for a variety of
      issues (i.e., substance abuse, parenting skills), anger management and
      conflict resolution training, life skills (i.e., learning how to budget
      one's money, shop for values, take care of an apartment), education (i.e.,
      completing an Adult Basic Education and G.E.D. degree), literacy training,
      child abuse counseling and abuse prevention, job training and placement,
      housing assistance, food banks, and other services as the community allows.</p>
      <p> After determining the kind
    of help their clients need, probation/parole officers match their needs with appropriate social
      service agencies or community-based treatment programs. Their job has
    become one of brokering community services and monitoring their clients' progress and
      activities in them.</p>
      <p>Clients are also required to contact their probation/parole officers. The extent of
    their contact varies according to the level of supervision each client
    needs. Today, that need is determined, in part, by the kind of
    offender they are (i.e., the type of offense committed, prior record, etc.) and their willingness to respond positively to treatment.</p>

            clients was probation, parole, or institutionalization. Now we
            have various levels of supervision within probation and parole. The increase in these alternatives within supervision has been
            a positive development. And we also have alternative programs
            in the community such as community service, electronic monitoring of
            clients, and other things.</font></b>
            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;In the past, we didn't 
            specialize
            in our probation/parole services. Now we have officers who
            specialize in youths who have been abused, those with substance
            abuse problems, clients who are dangerous felons, sex offenders, and those who are gang members.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;I've found there are three kinds of clients. On
            just about anyone's caseload there are situational offenders -
            they did what they did because of the immediate circumstances. They're sorry they did
            what they did so they need very little supervision.</font></b><font size="2">
            </font><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">Then there are the clients who have no interest in
            changing no matter what we do for them. And it's not uncommon
            to spend a lot of energy trying to help them. Unfortunately,
            that takes time away from dealing with the third group - clients who
            could go either way. We need to be sure we focus enough
            attention on them.&quot;</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <p><b>Regular supervision</b>, the least restrictive level of supervision, requires that clients either call or
    mail their particulars to their probation or parole officer - sometimes only
    once a month. The particulars include reporting as to where they are working and living, who they
    are living with, and how they are doing.</p>
	<p>The next level up in supervision requires contact with the
    probation/parole officer once a week. Sometimes referred to as enhanced
    probation or <b>intensive probation</b>, it is sometimes used with more difficult cases. Visits of more than once a week are
    required of clients who are on intensive probation and may include
    home visits and visits to the clients' work place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
