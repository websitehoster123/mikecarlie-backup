  <blockquote>
    <p>While visiting an alternative middle school in St. Louis' inner-city, I
    was handed a blank envelop containing a statement written by a gang member
    on June 17, 1997. He originally gave the statement to one of
    his teachers, a coordinator of after-school programs at his school. The
    coordinator wanted to share it
    with me. In his own words, this is what the gang member wrote.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><b><font size="2">I've Come To This</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">I am the decisive element in the out come of my life,
      my dreams, and my goals. It is my personal approach that creates my
      surrounding my do's and don'ts.&nbsp; It is my daily mood from sun up to
      sun down that makes for a bad or a good day.&nbsp; As a person I posses
      the tremendous power to make life miserable embarrable or joyous.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of
      inspiration.&nbsp; I can humiliate or hurt, or comfort an embrace those in
      need.&nbsp; In any given situation it is my response to the call that
      decides whether a cresies will escalate or de-escalate an I have come to
      this conclusion.&nbsp; I am my own keeper know one can keep me from the
      wrong nor can I nor will I be deprived from the rights for know one can
      protect me better then me, I must know the difference from right and wrong
      an the final judgment will lie on know one but me.&nbsp; I have come to

    <p align="left">The probation and parole officers I interviewed shared certain perceptions of gangs and gang members. To
    some extent, their perceptions were determined by the location of their
    offices in their respective communities. The neighborhood in which an office
    was located determined
    where most of the gang members on their caseloads lived and, therefore, the
    officers' perception of the gang situation.</p>
    <p align="left">In one city, for example, there was a probation/parole office on the west
    side of town (Latino gang territory), another on the north side (Asian gang territory), and yet another in the central east side
    (African-American gang territory). Officers interviewed in each
    of the offices expressed views of the gang situation which reflected both
    their familiarity with the &quot;local&quot; gang situation and their lack
    of knowledge about the gang situation in other parts of the city.</p>
    <p align="left">Regardless of their location in the city, few
    probation/parole officers believed gang members came only from the
    poorest neighborhoods in a community. Rather, they felt gang members lived
    in every part of town, came from every social class, were of both genders,
    and represented practically all racial and ethnic groups in the city.
    However, when asked, most admitted gang members are more likely
    to come
    from the poorer parts of town.</p>
    <p align="left">
    The following is the answer I was given to the question &quot;What
    characteristics do your gang clientele share in common?&quot; While admittedly the view of only one probation and parole officer, it is
    representative of the answers given by many of the juvenile officers, probation and parole
    officers, and counselors I interviewed. This particular probation and parole
    officer had four years of experience working with gang clients in
    a city of 650,000 people.&nbsp;She said
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">They have anger control issues and they are beyond parental control
    - they're wild. They like taking risks and they walk away from
    commitments. If they are asked to do something from which they see no
    personal benefit, they are not likely to do it. They lack motivation
    to do things for which there is no clear personal benefit.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">They are male and highly stressed. They are quiet bombs waiting to
    go off. They want to be recognized and known and they often act
    without thinking of the consequences of their actions. They're impulsive.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Demographically speaking, they are in either one of two groups. One
    group are the ones who are 16 years of age or under. These are
    black males [in her caseload] who come from single parent families, from the
    lower&nbsp;economic strata of society and have no positive male role models
    in&nbsp;their lives. Instead, they have negative male role models -
    men who abandon them, don't work, they drink or do other drugs and are violent or&nbsp;lazy,
    and they don't care about other people. They seem to value
    nothing and have no conscience. They're cold hearted.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Then there are the 17 to 25 year olds. These gang members have
    discovered the differences between the criminal justice system and the
    juvenile justice system and have learned to manipulate the process. As
    juveniles they were wilder and louder, now they have become cold.&nbsp;Either they don't care about things or they hide their feelings. When
    they do something that might be considered wrong, they rationalize their
    actions and accept no guilt. Gang members in
    these situations feel they are simply &quot;teaching someone a lesson,&quot; much
    like the lessons <i>they</i> learned early in life.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">They were usually abused as children, although they didn't
    think of the
    treatment as abuse. They simply saw being beaten as being taught a lesson.
    It was the way one person communicated displeasure to another person.</font></b><font size="2">
    </font><b><font size="2">They lack formal education but are very smart. They were likely kicked out
    of school for misbehaving, not for having poor grades. They are calculating
    and, when they choose to do something, will&nbsp;go to great pains to plan
    their strategy for achieving their goal.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">
    They find it hard to leave the gang, much as anyone would find it difficult
    to leave a loving family. As to visions of the future, they don't see
    one for themselves other than premature death or imprisonment.</font></b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">A male probation and parole officer in a large mid-west city
    told me he believed gang youths have little hope about experiencing a
    positive future. I asked him why he thought they believed that and he
    said &quot;It's their family history. They don't see any pattern of
    success at home. And there are no positive role models at home and few
    in their neighborhood. It's about the nature of the inner-city - you know, high
    unemployment, underemployment, poor housing. It breeds desperation. They're desperate.&quot;
    I asked him what he thought probation/parole officers could
    do to counter this desperation and hopelessness. &quot;Get them busy
    working on their education,&quot; he said. If they're older, &quot;Get
    them job training. Keep them around positive influences.&quot; If the gang situation permeates the neighborhood, &quot;Then we need more
    neighborhood involvement&quot; to save these kids.</p>
    <p align="left">I asked a seasoned probation/parole officer to describe the
    environment from which his gang clientele come. He said &quot;People
    are living on top of one another and there is a lot of displaced hostility. They are angry and there are always new people moving into the
    neighborhood.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The Client <a name="Mix"> Mix</a></font></b></p>
<p align="left">Not all probationers and parolees are alike in the kinds of offenses they
commit. Among them are murderers, people who commit assault, sex
offenders, gangsters, the psychologically disturbed, and others. Larger probation and parole offices are designed to meet the demands and needs
of these various categories of offenders by having their officers specialize. Smaller, sometimes rural,
offices are not specialized and individual officers must each learn to deal with a wide
variety of offender types.</p>
<p align="left">Gang member offenders are, in the words of one probation and parole officer,
&quot;a breed apart.&quot; The nature of their offending distinguishes
them from non-gang offenders. Gang members have a cadre of fellow
gangsters who encourage and support their criminality. If helping a non-gang offender change his or her life to break away from criminality is
difficult, it is even more difficult to accomplish the same end with clients
whose associates discourage change and demand continued criminality.</p>

<p align="left">From what I observed, there are at least three ways in which a
probation/parole office may configure the use of its personnel in order to deal with gang
member clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Most probation departments and parole units have not
  given special attention to the gang problem, particularly through special
  units and procedural arrangements. However, innovative approaches have
  been developed, for example, in Los Angeles, San Jose, San Diego, and Orange
  County in California.&nbsp;The specialized programs emphasize suppression in
  collaboration with law enforcement, and to a lesser extent, close coordination
  with community-based youth service agencies. These programs may involve
  vertical case management and intensive supervision.</font></b></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Which Format is <a name="Best">Best</a>?</font></b></p>
<p align="left">There are arguments on both sides of the issue as to whether one or the other
format for assigning gang clientele should be used. Favoring specialized case
loads are the arguments that officers with only gang clients develop a greater
understanding of their clients' social environment, gang, their clients' role in the
gang, and the nature of the people with whom clients associate. According
to this premise, given the
unique culture of a gang, a better understanding of it should facilitate the
process of helping clients help themselves.</p>
<p align="left">Arguments against specialization include the heightened danger to which
affected probation or parole officers may be exposed, the amount of stress that dealing
with gang members may produce in the officers, and the resulting labeling of
clients as gang members due to whom their cases were assigned (dealing with them
as gang members first rather than as individuals).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Commentary">Commentary</a> from the Field</font></b></p>
<p align="left">I asked several probation/parole officers whether they thought having a
specialized gang caseload was a good idea or not. What follows are the
responses of two officers, both of which reflect the larger group
interviewed. One of the officers had a
gang specialized caseload, the other had a gang emphasis in her caseload (some of her
    clients are not gang members). Here's how they answered the
    question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Joan, the gang specialist officer, in an email received in July of 2001,
    wrote&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">If an officer truly is interested in assisting
    gang members to overcome this lifestyle, a specialized caseload would help
    them become more familiar with ways to get out of a gang, where to send
    someone for tattoo removal, where to send gang members for counseling, etc.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Having a specialized gang caseload affords the officer the
    opportunity to personally know the gang members in the community. At times,
    I have asked the assistance of other gang members in locating clients (other
    gang members), and in encouraging these clients to report. If a gang member
    was having serious problems, I have had ex-gang members assist in providing
    pro-social support.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Finally, I was able to begin new programs to assist gang
    members and their families, i.e., &quot;How to Gang-Proof Your Child&quot;-
    through a local treatment agency, educating elementary, middle school, and
    high school students with the assistance of ex-gang members, the &quot;Stress Management Program&quot; at the Probation and
    Parole Office where a massage therapy program was used to help reduce
    assaultive behavior, the late night basketball program between cops and
    gang members, and a public art
    project that involved at-risk kids that could be or were already attracted to
    gangs.</font></b></p>
</blockquote>
    <p align="left">Suzanne, the other officer, wrote</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">I think
    they should be specialized. Gang members are a breed apart. With the ones I
    have worked with, if you gain a form of trust and respect up front, they
    will turn their lives around. If they bounce from officer to officer, like a
    normal caseload does, then there is no trust and respect.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Many of them are lacking something in their childhood that they think
    they get from the gang. One of those things is stability.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    provided this [to one of my gang clients] from the beginning.&nbsp; His mom
    took off and he didn't know where she went but I was there. He went to jail,
    had different employers, brothers and sister came and went, friends came and
    went, girlfriends came and went ... but I was there.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">I noticed if I got clients from an officer that didn't like gang members
    or didn't really 'care' about them, then I can't develop the kind of
    relationship I need to get them to succeed on their probation. That is also
    why an officer that doesn't want to work with gang members shouldn't.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

    the enjoy the buzz. No matter what relationship you have with them, they
    will not stop until they want to, no matter what support you offer them. Sex
    offenders are assigned to specialized officers for the same reason. You
    have to develop a relationship with them in order to understand them and get
    that trust.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left">The command personnel I interviewed in police departments with gang units
expressed the opinion that organizing to deal with
the gang situation was more effective than not organizing for it. That is,
police departments with a unit that specialized in gangs were viewed as
more effective in dealing with the local gang phenomenon than departments which did not specialize. Likewise, prosecutors
expressed the same belief and have, in many jurisdictions,
assigned one or more of their deputy prosecutors to specialize in gang cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> This
trend toward specializing at the law enforcement and prosecutorial levels begs
the question Why shouldn't juvenile and adult probation and parole officers
specialize in the same manner? The knowledge each gathers is
enhanced by specialization and has the potential for facilitating communication
among all parties.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">What <a name="Kinds"> Kinds</a> of Services do Gang Clients Need?</font></b></p>
<p align="left">Like many non-gang clientele, gang clientele often require
a wide range of services in order to be helped out of the situation in which
probation/parole officers find them. The services required run the gamut from needing a substitute family to job training and legitimate
employment opportunities, as
noted in the discussion of 
<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm#top">why
gangs form</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Observations in the field suggest the most needed services are for anger
management (being able to resolve conflicts without resorting to physical
violence),
substance abuse intervention, individual counseling to deal with the impact
of the client's home life on their current situation (i.e., abusive and/or drug
dependent parents), academic preparation (i.e.,
learning to write and read, completing a high school or equivalent education),
and job training and placement. Helping replace gang associates with
non-gang friends is a must and a challenge to accomplish.</p>

        There needs to be more field work since a large portion of their problem
        is being in the gang itself, so you need to ensure they are steering

        that are familiar with gangs and who specialize in dealing with them, what they are going through, and their frame of mind.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;Substance abuse issues will always

<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The Ingredients Needed for <a name="Successful"> Successful</a> Treatment</font></b></p>
<p align="left">At least five ingredients are needed in order for the treatment of gang- and
non-gang members on probation or parole to be successful. First, the community must be
sufficiently concerned about
juvenile delinquents and criminals to provide treatment services for them. Without services, there are no alternatives to incarceration.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Second, probation and parole officers must know about the services that are available.
This requires a willingness on the part of the officers to learn what programs are
out there and to participate in on-going training (i.e., to learn about new
services, new technologies).</p>
<p align="left">Third, judges must know about and be willing to 
recommend alternative sentences (i.e., to community-based services).</p>
<p align="left">Fourth, offenders must be motivated to change their own behavior. The absence of any of these criteria will negatively impact the outcome of the
probation/parole process.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, employers and landlords must be willing to extend job 
training, jobs, housing and other basic elements of social life to those who are 
on probation/parole or who have successfully completed their probation/parole.</p>

<p align="left">Sharing observations, insights, and simply listening to and caring about clients<b>  
</b>has a positive impact on certain gang members. Several officers told me they felt this
was more likely to occur with very young offenders and much older
ones. Some of the young ones, they felt, could be diverted from further
immersion into a gang by providing a positive alternative because they are not yet
committed to the gang life. Older gang clients - 24 or 25 years of age or older in the officers'
experience - are sometimes willing to listen to advice and participate in
treatment because they are tired of the gang life, suffered enough pain, are getting married and/or becoming parents, or for any combination of these or other
reasons.</p>

<p align="left">I observed a variety of in-house probation/parole programs in
which gang- and non-gang clients participated. The content of the programs
emphasized the development of self-esteem and learning how to work cooperatively
with others. An example of one such program was Day Report. While neither intended nor designed specifically for gang clientele, gang
members are sometimes sent to a Day Report Center for treatment. The
program, supervised by probation and parole staff, typically requires participants to be involved for periods of from one to several
months and for several hours every week day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Among the activities in which they participate are small group discussions
focusing upon values and ethics, high school equivalency (G.E.D.) classes,
meetings with social workers and psychologists, and group activities which build
trust and confidence. Job training may be offered by outside professionals
and
presentations may be made on how to search for a job, complete a job application and
other contracts, manage one's own finances, and where and how to shop for
bargains.</p>

<p align="left">Among other tactics used by some probation and parole
    officers are unannounced home and place of employment visits. Due to the risks involved, this doesn't seem to be a
    very popular tactic, but it may be an effective one. Among other
    things, a surprise visit may reveal who clients are associating with,
    whether they are using illegal drugs, and if they are going to work (or
    school, or a mandated treatment program) or not.</p>
<p align="left">Scheduling office visits can be a tricky matter if clients
    from rival gangs arrive in the waiting room at the same time. This
    occurred in one of the research cities just days before I arrived. Holes in the walls
of the Waiting Room from chairs being thrown were visible evidence of the
    mayhem that resulted.</p>

            pockets on to my desk. If I find a pager or cell phone I use
            it to find out what phone numbers the client has been getting calls
            from or is calling.&quot; She then checks those names with the
            names of persons the client is not allowed to associate with
            according to his or her conditions of probation or parole.</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <p align="left">Some probation and parole officers use gang databases 
    created by
    law enforcement agencies in their jurisdictions. The
    databases are valued for several reasons, among them their ability to
    provide information needed prior to a home visit (knowing if there may be a
    safety concern) and their use in keeping conflicting gang members from
    coming into contact with one another during office visits to the probation
    and parole office.</p>
    <p align="left">There may be other tactics used with gang members, but most
    of the tactics used are also used with non-gang member clients since, other
    than their gang status, they share much in common with them (i.e., a need
    for structure, discipline, and schooling, a relationship with a caring adult, a positive
    role mode, guidance, assistance in finding a job or job training, housing,
    marital/relationship counseling, and food).</p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Extending">Extending</a> Oneself</font></b></p>
<p align="left">A parole officer with a specialized case load of dangerous felons expressed her belief
that one of the solutions to the gang situation is better parenting. She
believed this so completely that she signed up for and received special training
on effective parenting so she could offer it to clients who needed it.</p>
<p align="left">Upon completing the course she gathered related information to share with all of
her nearly 100 fellow probation and parole officers and sent an announcement asking them to send her clients they thought would profit
from the training. &quot;A few weeks later,&quot; she said, &quot;no one replied
and no one has sent me a client. I think the reason for that is it
would require additional conversation with their clients during appointments and
consume too much of the officers' time.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Like several other probation and parole officers I interviewed, she believes many of her colleagues simply follow the conditions of
probation/parole as handed down by the court and don't add anything - even if it
would help the client.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        something.&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; he replied. &quot;I
        don't have time for that. I'd have to drop him [give him a urine
        test], analyze the sample, and write up a report. I don't have time

<p align="left">In another community, three female probation/parole officers were offering a Positive
Solutions program (see the link below to another Positive Solutions program) to their clients, which included a few gang
members. The problem was that all three were volunteers because their
administrator didn't have resources available to hire trained personnel to run
the program. The three well-intended but incompetent officers struggled
through something about which they knew very little, but they were determined to
try and help.</p>
<p align="left">Some probation and parole officers do much more than their jobs
require. They volunteer for community-wide efforts of all kinds including
those that focus on improving the life of children and families. One
of the officers I observed won the city's &quot;Volunteer of the Year
Award.&quot; But these, and similar efforts, have a negative impact both on the
amount of time spent with clients and on the general stress level of the
officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">How successful are their <a name="efforts">efforts</a>?</font></b></p>
<p align="left">The officers I interviewed thought that, if success in their work meant
their clients didn't get arrested again, they had a 20% to 40% success rate. None
of them knew with any certainty whether they had been successful or not. There
is no formal mechanism for obtaining feedback on whether a client ever
reoffended or not.</p>
<p align="left">Other
officers defined success as &quot;breaking the law less often,&quot; &quot;only
getting high once in a while instead of all the time,&quot; or &quot;holding a
job for 2 months instead of just 2 days.&quot; No probation/parole office had
statistics on the recidivism rate of their clients.</p>
<p align="left">Nor was information available on whether one type of program worked better
than another in reducing participation in gang activity among gang clients. Everything presented to me was either hearsay or conjecture.
I
wonder how much of it was wishful thinking.</p>
<p align="left">This brief overview of some of the forms of treatment provided by probation
and parole officers may serve as a backdrop against which we can explore our
next topic - a &quot;typical&quot; morning of office visits from gang
clients.</p>
