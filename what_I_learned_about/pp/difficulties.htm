      <p>From having too few probation/parole officers, to excessive paperwork, undesirable working conditions (i.e., small
      offices, insufficient storage space at work, outdated technology, lack of
      privacy, inadequate libraries of needed information), there are many
      aspects of being a probation/parole officer that make doing the job well nearly impossible. Perhaps
      the most egregious offender in this line of work is having too many
      clients (case overload).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There are other difficulties. Among them are the dual nature of being a
      probation/parole officer (social worker or cop?), dangers involved in
      working with convicted offenders, incompetent administrators and fellow
      officers, difficulties related to working with gang clientele, a lack of
      throughcare, working with police who are obstructionist, prosecutors and
      judges who are too lenient, and a community that is in denial about the
      gang situation or unwilling to provide resources needed to reduce gang
      activity.</p>

    <p>Probation and parole officers are caught in a struggle. On the one
    hand they are social workers - expected to care about their clients and to help them help themselves in modifying their behavior. On the other hand
    they are law enforcement officers - when clients violate a condition of
    their probation or
    parole, probation/parole officers are expected to enforce the law and have a client
    arrested or sent back to prison. This dual role of social worker and police

        Over the past year her caseload of 250 clients has been reduced to 130. 
      At her request, it consisted primarily of gang members. She recently requested a transfer to

        about that neighborhood's Latino gangs. Given that a gang
        member has taken a contract out on her life, and that there is another

    it's visiting the homes of gang member clients or dealing with inebriated
    gang members during an office visit, probation and parole officers are at risk.</p>

            call him later today and ask him to come into the office tomorrow

            asked if she could arrest him and she told me she can't do

    <p>A juvenile officer I was interviewing expressed her concern about the
    families of the youths she has as gang clients. She told me &quot;In this
    county we don't make home visits. It's too dangerous. We don't have guns
    like the state probation and parole officers do. And the parents can't be
    forced to come to our offices. We have no process for making that
    happen.&quot; Her comment made me wonder about how juvenile officers could
    possibly identify problems
    in a client's family without meeting and talking with family members
    and observing them as they interact with their child. How do they
    determine what help the child/client
    needs? How can they effect a change in the family, if that's
    what is needed?</p>
    <p>I believe there is a risk of harm at work, too. No metal detectors were installed at the entrance to any of the
    probation
    and parole offices I visited. Of the administrators I spoke to about
    this, all were hesitant to install metal detectors due to the cost of the system
    and a full time person to monitor it.&nbsp;One of the
    offices I visited had approximately 200 probation and parole officers. Local police told me there were
    over 5,000 documented gang members in that city. No one knew
    how many of the documented gang members were on the client list at probation/parole, but
    they knew they had many of them. I wondered how long will it be before one of the gang
    member clients comes to the
    office with a gun.

    <p>Probation and parole officers are up against terrible
    odds. In all of the jurisdictions I visited, case loads were large
    and prohibited any meaningful individual attention to clients. Officer pay was
    low, training was subpar and seldom on-going, inner-office
    rivalries were rampant, and apathy made the work environment less than desirable.&nbsp;Administrators
    are the individuals responsible for most, if not all, of these
    conditions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    In some cases it was clear that the source of the problems officers were
    having was due to incompetent administrators. Among the grievances
    expressed were a &quot;lack of creativity among our bosses&quot; when it
    came to trying out new ideas and a certain &quot;rigidity in their
    thinking&quot; about what should be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Bryan Hart, a probation and parole officer with a specialized caseload of
    &quot;dangerous felons,&quot; posted on his office door
    a list of places where clients could get free food.&nbsp; It was posted
    so that his and other probation/parole clients would be able to see it and avail
    themselves of needed food supplies. Upon seeing the list, Hart's supervisor told him to remove it from his door.
    Hart said he wanted to post
    it, so his supervisor told him he could post it on a nearby bulletin board. Hart
    told him &quot;That's not a good place to put it, someone will take
    it.&quot; The supervisor told him it wouldn't be touched. The sign
    disappeared in a few days.<br>
    <br>
    Similar difficulties arose when Hart searched the <i> Yellow Pages</i> of the local
    phone book for the
    names and addresses of all the temporary employment agencies in the community. Told by his supervisor that he would not be allowed to post it, he asked for permission to distribute
    copies of the list to the other probation and parole officers. The
    supervisor, after some convincing, allowed him to make and distribute the
    copies. I wondered why the administrator was being so obstructionist.</p>
    <p>Kathy Scroggins is a probation and parole officer who acts as liaison
    between the Office of Probation and Parole and the criminal courts in a
    community of nearly 500,000 people. She is the only officer with this
    unique assignment. According to Scroggins, &quot;Our agency (probation
    and parole) isn't
    doing anything for these gang members. We tell them what to do, but we
    don't actually show them how to do it. They need to know how to dress
    for a job interview, for example, but we don't show them where they can buy suitable clothes at an affordable price, or how to wear them.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She believes &quot;Our regional administrator is of the opinion that gang
    misbehavior is no different and deserving of no more attention than the
    misbehavior of non-gang members. This fails to recognize the
    seriousness of the 'gang mentality' issue and the lure gangs present
    to neighborhood children and their introduction into the gang life.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left">Most of the probation and parole offices I visited had no
    gang specialists in their midst. Instead, gang-member clients were
    distributed randomly among all the officers. On several occasions I
    asked officers to tell me about their gang clientele. The most common
    reply was &quot;I don't know if any of the people on my caseload are gang
    members. I mean, maybe there are two or three, but that's about
    it.&quot; If they don't know if their clients are in gangs or not it makes
    their work more difficult.</p>
    <p align="left">I was curious if the officers knew about their gang
    clients' gangs. Unless they had a significant caseload of gang-member
    clients, they knew little, possessed inaccurate information, or they knew nothing. They, like many of their administrators, viewed gang member
    clients the same way they viewed non-gang member clients. Gang members were
    simply people who needed services and the services they needed weren't
    different just because they were gang members.</p>

    <p>According to the probation and parole officers I interviewed and
    observed, gang clients present a unique set of circumstances which make
    the work of a probation and parole officer more difficult. Officers estimated that three-fourths or
    more of their gang clients had a problem with substance abuse and nearly all of them suffered
    from abuse as a child. Some gang members are angry and are continually
    acting out. This behavior makes it difficult for officers to develop a
    caring attitude or trust and complicates the relationship they have with
    such clients.</p>
    <p>Officers identified their gang clients' affiliation with fellow gang
    members as a particularly difficult barrier to overcome. The strength
    of the ties some gang members have to one another becomes a
    barrier to their personal development and change. In
    addition, their defensiveness and feeling that
    their probation/parole officers don't understand their situation frustrates
    the relationship between them. Many officers felt gang member clients failed to perceive the situation they were in as a
    &quot;problem.&quot; Without that perception, they felt, there can be no change.</p>

    <p>Officers stressed the
    importance of having their clients complete a high school or G.E.D. degree. Most said this was difficult, if not impossible, for their clients to do because it requires working
    fewer hours each day or not at all. Their clients' need for money to pay for rent, food, transportation, and care
    of their family, if any, results in a low priority for completing
    school. And without a high school degree, what promise is there for
    gang members, or anyone else, to make something of themselves?</p>

    <p>The vast majority of probation and parole officers I met, including those
    I interviewed and observed as they worked, were Caucasian females, most of
    the them in their 20s and 30s. Many of their clients were Latino- or
    African-American males aged 17 to 25. I believe the racial/ethnic and gender differences, and
    the difference in their social class affiliation, added to the distance
    between the two groups and made it more difficult for the officers to work
    with their clients - or <i>visa versa</i>.</p>
    <p>I asked a juvenile officer &quot;What <i>does</i> work?&quot; and she said
    &quot;Nothing! It puts a lot of responsibility on the juvenile
    officer. They have to develop an ability to read what's going on with
    their clients through facial expressions and other clues. It's all so
    archaic. There's no money to do what we really need to do, very few resources,
    no incentive for doing more or doing your work better, pay is low - but we
    love the kids!&quot;</p>

    <p align="left">In the British system of justice &quot;throughcare&quot;
    refers to the continuity of treatment of offenders prior to incarceration,
    while they are incarcerated, and during parole. This practice is rare
    in the United States.</p>
    <p align="left">One of the gang-specialized probation and parole officers I
    interviewed expressed her concern that &quot;The file that is developed
    on a client prior to incarceration doesn't follow that client into the
    institution. Instead, the case worker or probation/parole officer in
    the institution begins the process of learning about the client's background
    all over again. And, when he's released from the institution, the
    institutional file is kept at the institution and not passed on to the
    client's parole officer. Once again, the process of learning about the
    client's past begins. There's no continuity.&quot; When asked why a throughcare
    policy has not been adopted, she said &quot;Our state moves very slowly.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">Somewhat analogous to the lack of throughcare is the
    situation in the United States wherein delinquent records of juveniles
    are not legally accessible to police and adult probation and parole officers.</p>

    <p>A probation and parole officer shared with me her concerns related to her
    clients' criminal activities. She enjoyed having good relations
    with the local police department because she knew who to call when she
    needed a client arrested or needed to know more about a client's
    activities. &quot;That's why it's important to have a good working
    relationship with police,&quot; she said. &quot;I need them and they
    need me for information I often have and can share with them.&quot;</p>

    <p>When they refuse to share information, police are further empowering gang
    members in their community. Knowledge is a powerful tool in efforts to
    reduce gang activity and a lack of it cripples such efforts. One of the most dedicated probation and parole officers I observed told
    me of her difficulties in working with the police. She told me that
    during a recent investigation of a drive-by-shooting, the police &quot;never
    called me to help determine who the shooter may have been.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As a result of her own initiative,
    however, she figured out who it may have been, shared that name with the
    police and, not surprisingly, it was a good hit. The police arrested the suspect she identified and charged him with the
    shooting. &quot;If only the police would work with me, things
    would be so much better,&quot; she said. &quot;But, instead, they think they know
    everything.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I experienced police resistance to sharing intelligence when my request
    to attend a regional conference on gangs was denied. I had completed
    two years of in-the-field research on gangs and had been allowed to ride
    with and interview dozens of police in as many communities. None of
    that mattered to the police responsible for the regional conference. They were not willing to share their intelligence with &quot;an
    outsider.&quot;</p>

    <p align="left">Judges and prosecutors make some very important decisions as
    regards juvenile and criminal offenders. They determine if an
    alleged offender's case will be heard in court and, if found delinquent or
    convicted, what the consequences of his or her wrongdoing will be (within
    the confines of the law, of course). Making
    either of those decisions without complete information is hazardous, at
    best.</p>
    <p align="left">If juvenile officers are unfamiliar with the gang situation
    in their community, how can they prepare meaningful sentencing recommendation to the
    judge? The same
    concern applies in terms of adult offenders. Criminal courts do not
    have access to adult offenders' juvenile records. How can a meaningful decision be reached as to how to treat/punish
    those adult offenders?</p>

            even when we prepare careful cases in favor of revocation of their

    I believe that prosecutors offices which fail to use vertical prosecution in

    members can be helped, if given the appropriate treatment/punishment. Probation and parole officers also lose since offenders are likely to be
    given inappropriate sentences which result in their return to probation or

    <p>I would have preferred to conclude this section with a positive
    note. Based upon what I saw and heard, however, the odds of a juvenile officer or
    an adult probation/parole officer being able to help gang members
    reduce their offending are very small. In too many cases, nearly everything
    is working against them in this effort. On the other hand, in those few instances where client and officer
    motivation intersected with community willingness to help, <a href="../GANGS/getting_out_of_a_gang.htm#Robbie">lives
    were changed</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I need to add a disclaimer at this point. There are many large cities in
    the United States which I did not visit and it is possible (I would think
    highly probable) that some of them have probation a parole officers with
    gang-specialized officers. If I had interviewed them my findings may have
    been different.</p>
    <p> Sometime counselors are able to help gang clients help
    themselves. Sometimes they aren't. That's our next topic.</p>
