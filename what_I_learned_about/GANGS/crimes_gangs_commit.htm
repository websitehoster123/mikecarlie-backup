    <p>Gang members commit crimes against members of their own gang, members of
    rival gangs, and against non-gang members.&nbsp;Depending upon the nature
    of the gang and the individual members in it, the crimes they commit vary. Drug-oriented gangs commit
    drug-related crimes. But not all gangs are involved in drugs. They may specialize in the theft of cars or
    theft from cars, shoplifting, or have no specialty and commit a variety of
    crimes. According to Egley's<font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Egley2000">1999</a>)</font> survey of over 3,000

    <p>Potential gang members and the general public seem to think there is a
    great deal of money to be made by gang members who sell illegal drugs on the
    streets of American cities. Levitt and Venkatsesh <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#PJA1998">1998</a>)
    </font>, economists and social
    researchers, recently reported that few of the members of the inner-city African-American gang they
    studied made more than minimum wage selling illegal drugs.&nbsp;
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">They found that, contrary to public perceptions, few
      gang members pocket lots of money. Indeed, says Levitt, the gang members
      could not make a living off their profits from drug sales alone.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Over a four-year period in the late 1980s and early
      1990s, a former gang member, who now works in the legitimate business
      sector, kept careful records of his gang's profits, passing the
      information to Venkatesh on loose-leaf sheets copied from the gang ledger.
      Levitt then created an economic model based on the gang's general expenses
      and its revenue from drug dealing and membership dues. For safety reasons,
      Levitt and Venkatesh chose to keep confidential their sources and the
      now-defunct gang's whereabouts and members.</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The focus gang had a leader, three officers, about 75
      foot soldiers, and some 200 rank-and-file individuals. The gang leader
      pocketed a documented average of $100,000 a year. Officers, who managed
      gang funds and drug operations, received an average of $1,000 a month,
      says Levitt, while the foot soldiers, the equivalent of part-time workers,
      earned no more than minimum wage selling drugs on the streets.
      Rank-and-file individuals, the freelancers of the drug world, did sporadic
      drug dealing for the gang. </b></font><font size="1">(University of

            seasoned gang member and drug dealer told me &quot;There are
            only a few gang members who realize that there is money enough for
            everyone. Those who recognize this go about their work of
            sellin' drugs in a more laid-back way. The gang members
            who do not see this are more anxious, pushier, they rush up on
            potential customers.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            While he didn't see any accumulation of wealth within gangs he did
            suggest that &quot;Two gang members might pool their money, ones who
            really trust one another. But they have to be wary of fellow
            gang members and of rivals in these situations.&quot; &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            For gang members selling drugs on the street he said &quot;They
            probably turn down more deals than they make ... there are so many
            undercover cops out there trying to buy drugs. In a good day a single seller may
            net six hundred to two thousand dollars [the sale of one or two ounces of

            &quot;The supplier might be a member of the gang with his own connections
            or someone from outside the gang.&quot;<br>

            When asked &quot;Why not have a legitimate job so you don't have to
            worry about police and being arrested and all of that?&quot; he said
            &quot;You mean an eight hour day? Pay taxes? I can't earn enough that way.
            Now, some gang
            members start out that way, but then they have to add to that in
            order to have enough money, see that they can make much more sellin'

    <p>As Table 34 (below) indicates, only 25-38% of the gangs studied in 1998 were

    The very next year, Egley &quot;estimated that 46
    percent of youth gang members are involved in street drug sales to generate
    profits for the gang.&quot;&nbsp;<font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Egley2000">Egley</a>,

    <p>A gang member I interviewed observed that in Oklahoma City and
    Chicago &quot;What was once a focus on territory has turned into making money selling drugs.
    That's why
    there's been a decline in drive-by-shootings, killings, assaults and general
    gang mischief.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    He told me there are few turf battles in those cities because of
    the plentiful supply of drugs and the large demand for them. There is
    no reason for conflict over drug sales. &quot;There's enough for
    everyone,&quot; he said, &quot;so what's to fight about? Besides, you fight, you get hurt,
    you can't sell drugs, you're not making money! On a good day I
    can make between two hundred and five hundred dollars. A really good dealer can make from
    two thousand to four thousand a day, easily. I rode with a dealer one morning and in just three hours he had made
    eleven hundred dollars in sales for drugs that cost him around three
    hundred.&quot;

            poster child. Both are dressed in clean and bright clothes,
            they're groomed well and are very polite. Recently, Karen was awarded
            a &quot;Success Certificate&quot; for her positive achievements
            while on probation. She has a new boyfriend and is
            happy, as is her probation officer, that he is a positive influence
            in her life.<br>
            <br>
            Karen is paying restitution to the victims of her crime - stealing
            blank checks, forging them and cashing them at area banks. The
            proceeds were used to support her drug addiction. She
            drove through a bank drive-thru to cash one of the checks and,
            because the transaction was caught on film, she was found and
            arrested.</font></b></p>

    <p>Gang members who get involved in drugs may be initiated
    into their involvement in several different ways. Sometimes it's not a
    matter of choice, or the choice is a rather narrow one, as in the following
    case.<br>

            I had been told, and had seen, that drugs are sometimes sold around
            the neighborhood park, so I asked Maurice about this. &quot;Is
            the park a center for drug sales?&quot; &quot;Well, drug sales
            could be made in cars, in houses, on the streets, yeh, in the park,&quot;
            he said. &quot;They happen everywhere. I don't know if
            there's a center or central place where they happen. It's like
            mercury. The police bust some people here, it goes somewhere

    <p>In their study of the police response to gangs, Katz and Webb found two 
	explanations for why there may have been an increase in gang involvement in 
	drug sales in the 1980s - a period which may be characterized as the crack 
	decade.<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>First, in the early 1980s, crack cocaine use 
		escalated dramatically, and a new drug market emerged. Because the new 
		market had not yet stabilized, violence was often used as a regulatory 
		mechanism. Second, at about the same time, the economic infrastructure 
		of many inner cities collapsed. Manufacturing jobs declined, and service 
		and technology jobs, which began to drive the new economy, were being 
		created in suburban communities. The economic restructuring of the 
		nation left unqualified and geographically isolated urban minority youth 
		without the means or opportunity for employment. The new crack cocaine 
		market provided opportunities for inner-city youth to make money. </b>

	<p>Among the drug-related crimes gang members commit are the cultivation
    (i.e., marijuana) and manufacture (i.e., methamphetamine, crack cocaine) of
    illegal drugs as well as trafficking (distribution), sales, and possession.
    Some gangs or gang members are also involved in the theft of manufactured
    drugs (i.e., amphetamines, barbiturates, ecstasy) for the purpose of selling
    them for a profit or for their own consumption.<p><a name="Remove"></a>No 
	conversation about drugs and youth would be complete without giving at least 
	some attention to the matter of substance abuse and addiction, whether it is 
	gang related or not. As reported by The National Center on Addiction and 
	Substance Abuse at Columbia University:<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Drug and alcohol abuse is implicated in all types 
		of juvenile crime, including almost 70% of violent offenses, 72% of 
		property offenses, and more than 80% of other offenses, such as 
		vandalism and disorderly conduct. </b></font></p>
		<p><b><font size="2">The problem is, virtually nothing is being done to 
		stem this disturbing tide. CASA found that some 1,900,000 of the 
		2,400,000 juvenile arrestees are drug and alcohol abusers or addicts. 
		Yet, only 68,600 of them-a mere 3.6%-receive any treatment. Moreover, 
		substance abuse is not the sole problem that goes unaddressed in these 
		kids' lives. Many come from broken and troubled families, have been 
		abused or neglected, live in crime-infested neighborhoods, and struggle 
		with learning disabilities and mental health problems such as depression 
		and schizophrenia.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font size="2">Alcohol and drug abuse and addiction go untreated. 
		While 44% of the 10- to 17-yearolds arrested in the past year already 
		meet the clinical definition of substance abuse or dependence (while 28% 
		meet the clinical test of hard-core addiction), less than four percent 
		receive treatment. These arrested juveniles are six times more likely to 
		be substance abusers and eight times more likely to be hooked on drugs 
		and alcohol than their contemporaries. </font><font size="1">(</font></b><a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#CASA2005"><font size="1">The

	<p>Whether a youth's abuse of or addiction to drugs was caused by gang 
	membership or led to gang membership is less important than educating youths 
	about the potential dangers of certain drugs and providing substance abuse 
	intervention programs whenever possible. Beyond drugs, there are other 
	crimes youths commit and that gang members commit. That's our next topic.</p>
