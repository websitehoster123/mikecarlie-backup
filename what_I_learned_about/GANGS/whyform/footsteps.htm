					<blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p align="left">Some of the children and young adults I interviewed joined
								a gang because one or more of their parents or siblings were gang
								members or because they had a friend who was a member of the gang. In some
								communities, particularly those populated by lower-class African-Americans
								and Hispanics/Latinos, there is a strong tradition of gang joining. Efforts
								to dissuade youth from joining gangs in this environment are complicated by
								that tradition.</p>
							<p align="left">The method of being initiated into a gang referred
								to as being &quot;<a href="../join_a_gang.htm#Blessed">blessed in</a>&quot;
								is testimony to the fact that gang joining is sometimes associated with parental,
								sibling,
								or peer gang membership.&nbsp;</p>
							<p align="left">I remember one interview in particular. A parole officer and
								I were in the living
								room of one of her adult gang member parolees. The gang member was joined by his wife as
								he held his
								3-month-old baby. His four-year-old son, dressed in blue,&nbsp; was also in the living
								room. To my amazement, as I was talking with his father and mother, the
								four-year-old threw a gang sign and mean-mugged the parole officer (gave her
								a dirty look). As we left the home the parole officer asked &quot;Guess what
								that little one is <a href="../../../Resources/glossary.htm#Wannabe">gonnabe</a>?&quot;
							</p>
							<p align="left">Edwin H. Sutherland was a respected criminologist who
								developed the notion that criminal behavior is learned and that it is
								learned through the process of &quot;differential association.&quot; He believed that
								people learned (and adopted) the values and behaviors of other people -
								especially people with whom they established relationships early in life,
								had frequent contact and maintained contact over a long period of time. He
								also suggested that if the other people were held in high regard, that also
								impacted whether the individual adopted his or her values and behaviors.</p>
							<p align="left">In our example above, children are likely to adopt the
								values and behaviors of their parents if the children hold their parents in
								high regard, have frequent contact with them early in life (while the
								children's value systems and behaviors are being established) and maintain
								that relationship over a long period of time. Should the parents have
								deviant values and behaviors, the child is likely to mimic those values and
								behaviors.</p>
							<p align="left">If the parents are missing (absent through work, neglect or
								abandonment, etc.), the child will attach to other people and will,
								according to Sutherland, adopt the values and behaviors of those to whom the
								child looks up, interacts with earliest in life, most frequently and over a
								long period of time. Looked at through Sutherland's eyes, some individuals
								adopt gang-like values and behaviors through the process of &quot;differentially
								associating&quot; more with others who exhibit similar values and behaviors than
								with people who exhibit non-deviant, non-gang values and behaviors.</p>
							<p align="left">Sutherland's notion also helps us understand the potential,
								and perhaps real, impact of the media on the formation of a child's value
								system and resulting behaviors as discussed in the
								<a
									href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/m/MichaelCarlie/what_I_learned_about/GANGS/whyform/mass_media_portrayals.htm">
									prior Topic</a> (Mass Media Portrayals of Gangs and Gang Members).
								Sutherlands developed his notion of differential association prior to the
								pervasiveness of televisions. Since that time, of course, we have found that
								many children spend hours every day watching television unmonitored by
								adults. Do you think that some of the values and behaviors exhibited on
								television today might have some influence on the development of a child's
								value system?
							</p>
							<p align="left">Similar in impact is Travis Hirschi's notion of &quot;Social
								Control Theory.&quot; Hirschi believed that people refrain from violating the law
								because they have a
								<i>stake in
									conformity</i>. That is, they believe that, if they follow the society's rules,
								they will be rewarded with success.
							</p>
							<p align="left">According to Hirschi, when a member of society's bond
								to that society is weak or broken they may become criminal. He believes
								that
								<a
									href="http://courses.missouristate.edu/michaelcarlie/advisenet/COURSES/480/The%20Cultural%20Dimensions%20of%20Crime.htm#Hirschi">attachment
									and commitment to and
									involveme</a><a href="file:///E:/advisenet/COURSES/480/travis%20hirshci.htm">nt and
									belief in</a> the values and goals of
								a
								society are what keep its members from offending.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p align="left">
									<font font><b>Attachment</b> refers
										to sensitivity to and interest in others.</font>
								</p>
								<p align="left">
									<font font><b>Commitment</b>
										involves time, energy, and effort expended in conventional lines of
										action.</font>
								</p>
								<p align="left">
									<font font><b>Involvement</b> in
										conventional activities leaves little time for illegal behavior.</font>
								</p>
								<p align="left">
									<font font><b>Belief</b> refers to
										the sharing of common moral beliefs, adhering to such values as sharing,
										sensitivity to the rights of others, respect for the legal code of the
										society.</font>
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p align="left">But what of children born into situations in which the bond to the
								larger society is already weak? Perhaps the parents are law
								violators. Perhaps being born into poverty presents
								some real challenges in terms of bonding with the larger
								society. A lower-class person can suffer rejection and
								discrimination at the hands of the middle- and upper-classes. A bond to
								middle-class values might be difficult to establish or justify.</p>
							<p align="left">What is the response of those children? Is it possible that
								some of them might join a gang because, lacking a bond to the larger
								society, they believe they will find a bond to the gang? Will
								they develop attachment, involvement, commitment, and belief in the gang
								culture? I think it's interesting to turn Hirschi's notion
								around as a way of explaining a gang member's relationship to his or her
								gang (having a bond to the gang instead of to the larger society).</p>
							<p align="left">Not only do some people join a gang by following in the
								footsteps of others, some form or join a gang simply because they can. No
								one even tried to stop them.</p>
