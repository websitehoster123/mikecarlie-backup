    other and to symbolize their gang
    affiliation. Among
    the most common are the use of graffiti, tattoos, wearing certain brands or colors of
    clothing, wearing clothes or other accessories in a certain way (i.e., folding up one pant's leg or the
    other, wearing a belt buckle to the left or right of center), <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Throwing"> throwing

	<p align="left">I was riding through a neighborhood in Kansas City and saw a
    roster of monikers - an entire gang's membership - painted on a telephone pole. It
    was a symbolic gateway, a marker, an entrance to the gang's neighborhood, and a clear indication of who
    owned it. Steve Nawojczyk wrote &quot;Graffiti has been called the
    newspaper or bulletin board for gangs and communicates many messages,
    including challenges, warnings, and pronouncements of deeds accomplished or
    about to occur.&quot; <font size="1">(Nawojczyk, no date, <a href="http://www.gangwar.com/dynamics.htm#graffiti">page</a>)</font>

    <p>Among other things, graffiti communicates who's around, who's with who, who's disrespecting who, role call
    (a roster of gang members),
    the hierarchy of gang members in a gang, the strength of the gang, which gangs are claiming
    what territory and which areas are in
    dispute. It may also be an advertisement for the type of activity in which the gang was
    or is still involved
and an announcement of who's getting ready to attack who (a moniker or gang member's name that is
    crossed out with an &quot;X&quot; is the likely target for an attack or
    murder) or who's already been killed.</p>

    of the

    residents who fail to remove graffiti are viewed as frightened and weak by
    those who created the graffiti.

    another to other people and making a statement to them about one's self. Among other things, they may signify
    gang affiliation, status in the gang, past ventures, and serve as symbols for
            memorials to gang members, family members, and significant others who have died.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

    experiences, the &quot;manliness&quot; of the person who suffered
    having the tattoos etched onto his or her body, and they often intimidate others. They
    certainly intimidated me.
    That's why I never looked at them or their carriers very
    closely. Now, I eagerly inspect any willing gang member's tattoos so I can learn more about
    what they mean or whatever else the tats may reveal. In every instance, gang
    members were eager to show them to me.

            gang specialist told me &quot;Most of these [Hispanic] gangs got their start in prisons.
            Since
inmates are not allowed to wear belts, the baggy pants were worn below the
            waist. That's where the trend of 'saggin' [wearing one's pants below
the waist] came from. It always amazes me that the street gang
members have no idea why they do some of the things they do - like saggin' -
and don't know the history behind them.<br>
<br>
            &quot;Prison gang members considered any inmate a fag [homosexual] who allowed the skin
above his knee to be exposed in public. So inmates always pulled down any
shorts that they wore so the hem was below their knees. Today,
that has translated into three-quarter length pants among gang members and,
again, they don't even know why that is done, or why it was done in the first
            place.</font></b>

            </a>&quot;Bloods and Crips ripped off their colors from the Hispanic
gangs. In the California prison system the only two colors of
bandanas could be worn by inmates - red and blue. That's how the
Hispanic gangs got their respective colors. One day a Surenos [southern
            California Mexican Mafia] gang
member began wearing a red bandana and his amigos began wearing red, too. The
Nortenos [northern California Mexican Mafia gang members], of course, started wearing the 
			red bandana to separate themselves
from the Surenos. I bet there isn't a Crip or Blood anywhere that
knows why they wear red or blue!&quot; (</font><font size="2">Read

    <p align="left">Clothing of various colors has, for centuries, indicated
    one's gang affiliation. Red is for Bloods, blue is for Crips, unless
    you're in another country where red and blue signify membership in other
    gangs. Orange and green are the colors of two faith-based gangs in
    Europe. I don't know if any gangs are into pastels (my favorite), but
    there are a rainbow of colors attributed to gangs across the world.
    </p>
    <p align="left">Accessories such as necklaces, bracelets, pins, and rings
    also may signify gang affiliation. The problem today is that much in the
    way of gang attire has crossed over into the youth culture generally and is worn by youth who are not gang affiliated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            or do tagger art and need a place to put their spray cans. They also like 'hoodies' [sweat shirts with a built in hood]

    <p align="left">Wannabes are known to sometimes brandish tattoos
    and other identifiers in their effort to be recognized as gang members, get
    arrested, and build a reputation for themselves. More experienced gang 
    members tend to camouflage their gang membership in order to avoid detection 
    by police and other rivals. Some gang members are even opting to have their

    removed</a> (<a href="http://www.chuckmuncie.org/tattoo.html">tattoo removal

    because they want to distance themselves from the gang (i.e., quit, get
    married and find legitimate employment). Some even try to leave their gang,
