    <p>For the purpose of this book, and consistent with much that is
            available in the literature of both police and social
            researchers, a distinction will be made between street gangs
    (synonymous with &quot;youth gang,&quot; posses, clicks/clickas [Latino/Hispanic] 
	and crews) and
            other types of gangs. Malcolm Klein is one of the most respected gang
            researchers in the United States today. Introducing one of his recent works, he wrote</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <b><font size="2">Our
            discussion, therefore, is of <i>street</i> gangs, not Skinheads,
            motorcycle gangs, and other groups ... &nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the gangs
            that researchers write about - juvenile, delinquent, youth - are
            depicted as hanging around, usually in the open. &nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            It may be at a street corner, a taco stand, or on the side of a park
            watching the action; they're somewhere in the open or in the open
            behind a building. They're smoking, drinking, roughhousing,
            playing a pickup ball game, messing with a few girls, or sauntering
            up a street in a possessive, get-outta-our-way fashion.<br>
            <br>
            Skinheads don't usually fit this picture. They're inside;
            they're working on their written materials; or if outside, they're
            looking for a target, not just lounging around. Bikers
            don't fit this street gang picture. They're focused on their
            machines, cruising, or dealing drugs in an organized manner, and
            like the Skinheads, they're deliberately recognizable rather than
            recognizable by default.<br>
            <br>
            Street gangs seem aimless; Skinheads and bikers are focused, always
            planning. Street gang members get into any and every kind of
            trouble. &nbsp;It's cafeteria-style crime - a little of this, a
            touch of that, two attempts at something else. Skins and
            bikers prefer narrower ranges of trouble.&nbsp;</font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Klein1995">Klein</a>,
      1995, p. 22.)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
            Klein also excludes satanic and cult gangs as well as punks and
            heavy metal-influenced stoners, car clubs, low riders, street corner
            pals and youthful play groups<font size="1">.</font><font size="2">
            </font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Klein1995">ibid</a>., pages 22-25.)&nbsp;</font>
            Likewise, Walter B. Miller, in discussing his newest study, writes</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>In conformity with the usage adopted by a
      national survey conducted by the <a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Moore1995">National
      Youth Gang Center in 1995</a>, several groups designated as 'gangs,' and
      'street gangs,' or 'criminal street gangs' were not considered youth gangs
      for purposes of [his report]. These groups are motorcycle gangs, ...
      hate or ideological gangs, ... and other types of adult gangs, including
      drug operations, syndicates, and organized crime gangs. A major
      objective was to maintain a distinction between youth gangs (ages 12-24)
      and exclusively adult gangs.</b> </font><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#WMiller2001">Miller</a>,

    <p>
    We will define&nbsp;a street gang
            as <b> <font color="#0000FF"> a group of two or more individuals who
    share an on-going relationship with one another and support one other, individually or
    collectively, in the recurring commission of delinquent and/or criminal acts</font></b>.
    This definition is similar to the definition of a gang used by the Florida
    Department of Corrections - &quot;A formal or informal ongoing
    organization, association, or group that has as one of its primary
    activities the committing of criminal or delinquent acts.&quot; <font size="1">(Florida
    Department of Corrections,&nbsp; <i>Gang and Security
    Group Threat Awareness, </i><a href="http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/gangs/faq.html">page</a>)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#800000"><b>Number of Members</b></font></p>
    <p>The definition for a gang I am proposing requires only two (2)
    participants, as does the definition of a gang used by the Los Angeles city
    and county police departments. I propose this for two reasons, one has to do with the
    sociological definition of a <i>group</i> and the other with the limits the current
    definition places upon police and prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The field of sociology has traditionally defined the smallest possible group
    as &quot;a dyad, which contains two people. A dyad can easily become the most
    cohesive of all the groups because its members are inclined to be most
    personal and to interact most intensely with each other.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Thio1998">Thio</a>,
    1998, p. 103)&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p>In a similar manner, sociologists distinguish between primary and
    secondary groups, regardless of their size. Primary groups are characterized
    by frequent interaction among their members and face to face interaction.
    Their members often have great influence over each other's actions and
    attitudes. In some cases, gangs could be defined as primary groups. On the
    other hand, &quot;The term secondary group refers to a formal, impersonal
    group in which there is little social intimacy or mutual
    understanding.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Thio1998">Thio</a>,
    1998, p. 145)</font>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Charles Horton Cooley coined the term <i>primary
      group </i>to refer to a small group characterized by intimate,
      face-to-face association and cooperation. The members of a street gang
      constitute a primary group; so do members of a family living in the same
      household, as well as &quot;sisters&quot; in a college sorority. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Thio1998">Thio</a>,
      1998, p. 145)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Many states' gang-related statutes define a gang as having three members.
    While it may be true that most gangs have more than three members, in the
    practice of criminal justice, this definition is too limiting. On several occasions while observing gang
    unit officers at work, two suspects were detained for having allegedly
    committed a crime together.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> In each case, the suspects were arrested
    together in one vehicle and were, by all appearances, members of a gang (i.e., they
    wore matching colors, had common tattoos, threw hand signs). They could be prosecuted as violators of the laws they broke
    but, because there were only two offenders in each case, they could not be
    tried as members of a gang. That would have required there be three suspects
    according to most state statutes.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000">Primary Activity</font></b></p>
    <p>Florida's definition of a gang has many elements found in other states'
    statutes. Among them is the reference to gangs having criminality as their
    &quot;primary&quot; activity. I believe that is a mistake. Few, if any,
    gangs have criminality as their primary activity. Most of their members'
    time is spent doing things most non-criminals do (i.e., eating, sleeping,
    socializing, listening to music, going to movies, attending parties). What
    makes a gang unique is not that criminality is their primary activity but
    that its members encourage and support one another in the <b>recurring </b>commission of
    crimes and/or acts of delinquency.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Even college and fraternal organizations periodically
      engage, either collectively or through individual members, in acts of
      deviance and/or crime. But to be considered a gang we must be willing to
      add the additional requirement that it be a recurring type of action. Not
      a one-time act of vandalism or outrage. Not a singular, spontaneous,
      event. Indeed, to be considered a gang characteristic the emphasis on
      illegal acts must have the quality of being recurrent, indeed ongoing.</b></font><font size="1">
      (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knox1994">Knox</a>,
      1994, p. 33)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font color="#800000">Gang Identifiers</font></b></p>
    <p>Characteristics, such as having a gang <i>name</i>, wearing
            clothes of a common <i>color</i>, being <i>tattooed</i>, and <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Throwing"> throwing <i>signs</i>
            </a>
            (the sign language of street gangs) are not included in the definition
    used in <i>Into the Abyss</i>, although their presence may be common among some street gangs.
            There are several reasons why I omitted these gang identifiers.</p>
    <p>Whether a gang's members wear a common color or not may depend upon how successful police suppression efforts are at any given
            time. The more oppressive, the less likely gang members will
            wear, do, or say anything that identifies them as a gang
            member. The less oppressive, the more likely they will
            exhibit their gang affiliation. The only likely exception are wannabes, who are sometimes flagrant about their supposed membership in a
    gang due to their desire to be seen as worthy of inclusion in it.</p>

                    the time they committed their crime. Incidents such as
                    this have led some states to simplify their legal definition

    <p><b><font color="#800000">Significant Differences Between Gang- and
    Non-Gang Offenders</font></b></p>
    <p>Despite the absence of having a name or exhibiting colors, etc., the definition
    used in <i>Into the Abyss</i> does suggest certain specific
    characteristics, characteristics which make a gang significantly different from
    non-gang delinquents or criminals. The following are among the significant
    differences:</p>
    <p>A gang is a <i><b>group</b></i>. A group is, in part, defined as an
    aggregate of people who see themselves as members of the group, who are seen
    as members by other members of the group, and who are viewed as members of
    that group by
    people outside the group. On the other hand, non-gang offenders are not part
    of a group of offenders.</p>
    <p>Members of a gang <i><b>interact</b></i> with each other in<i> <b>an
    ongoing-relationship</b></i>. Were a group of people to commit a crime
    together and never commit another crime together as a group it might be
    called a mob, but it should not be called a gang. Gang members commit crimes
    with one another (seldom all at the same time) several times over an
    extended period of time. Non-gang offenders can not do this.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Nor can non-gang offenders <i><b>support one another in the recurring commission of delinquent and/or criminal
    acts</b>. </i>This mutual support makes gang members significantly different
    from non-gang offenders and presents one of the most difficult barriers to
    intervention we face in attempting to draw youths out of gangs or for them
    to leave a gang willingly.</p>
    <p>According to George Knox, author of <i>An Introduction to Gangs</i>, an
    encyclopedic reference work on gangs,&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="2"><b>Crime involvement of a group must not ... be
              a <i>sub rosa</i>   [secret] function, about which few of the members have
              knowledge, if we are to consider the group a gang. Members
              of many legitimate voluntary associations and civic groups are
              sometimes arrested for a variety of offenses. &nbsp;</b></font></p>
              <p><font size="2"><b>But these are
              not offenses committed on behalf of their group; these are not
              offenses even necessarily known to their full social network;
              these are not offenses condoned and approved of in advance by
              their organization, or which enjoy their acceptance or blessing. To be considered a gang, the criminal involvement of members
              must be openly known and approved of as such.&nbsp;</b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Knox1994">Knox</a>,

    <p> The more
    I saw on the streets of American cities, and in the cities of other nations, the
    more I realized some of characteristics used to define a

    <p>In the final analysis, gang members'&nbsp;mutual support of criminal
    activities, and possession of a value system which condones such behavior, distinguishes
    gang members and gangs from all other offenders and groups  (i.e., a football team,
    fraternity
or sorority, a business organization).
    </p>

    <p>One half of all police departments participating in the 1998 <i>National
    Youth Gang Survey</i> used &quot;commits crimes together&quot; as a gang
    identifier. <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#NationalYouthGangSurvey">National
    Youth Gang Survey</a>, 2000)&nbsp;</font> Only 19% required that the gang have a name. Table
    45, below, confirms the fact that few police departments require that, in
    order to be a gang, a group must claim territory, display colors or other
    insignia, or anything else.

    <p>For our purposes, then a gang is a group of two or more individuals who
    have an on-going relationship and support one other, individually or
    collectively, in the recurring commission of delinquent and/or criminal acts.&nbsp;</p>
