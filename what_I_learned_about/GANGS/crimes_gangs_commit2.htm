      drugs or some other crime. While those types of gang homicides do occur,
      most are the product of old-fashioned fights over turf, status and
      revenge. Drive-by shootings and other confrontations of this kind
      typically involve small sets of gang members acting more or less on their
      own, not large groups representing an entire gang. But each attack creates
      a chain reaction of complicity, vengeance and commitment.</b></font><font size="1">

    <p>Los Angeles is, perhaps, the one community most often identified by
    Americans and Europeans as having a serious gang presence. The number
    of gang-related homicides in that community is shown in the bar graph below. If the OJJDP numbers are accurate, 450 of the 3,340
    gang-related homicides committed in 1997 were committed in Los
    Angeles. That's roughly 13.4% of all gang-related homicides in the
    United States that year. The
    population of the Greater Los Angeles area was about 3.4% of the population
    of the United States in 1997 yet its proportion of all gang related

<p>What Table 24 is telling us is that, in the 4,219 counties reporting to
the OJJDP in 1996, <b>gang members were involved at &quot;high,&quot; or
&quot;medium&quot; levels in 72% of all aggravated assaults and 46% of all robberies</b>.
This is disturbing as both of these crimes
are <i>crimes against persons</i> - they involve physically harming the victim,
or threatening harm.</p>

<p>Common assault is often considered less harmful than aggravated assault, 
which is defined as &quot;...an assault with a deadly weapon or with the intent to kill, rob,
or rape. An attempt to cause serious bodily injury to another or causing
such bodily injury knowingly or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme
indifference to the value of human life.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Statsky1985">Statsky</a>,
1985, p. 37)</font></p>

<p>The tally for <i>crimes against property</i> are no less disturbing as <b>gang
members participated at &quot;high&quot; or &quot;medium&quot; levels in 72%
of all burglaries, 62% of motor vehicle thefts, and 83% of all larcenies (theft)</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of the kinds of crimes committed by gang members are not included in Table 24.
Among them is extortion, or what is referred to by
some gangs as
&quot;paying rent&quot; or &quot;taxes.&quot; Rent or taxes are extorted
from store owners so their windows won't be broken, merchandise stolen or destroyed,
or employees and customers
beaten. Taxes may also be paid for the unhindered use of a street corner for the
purpose of selling illegal drugs or prostituting oneself.</p>

<p>In England, there currently are conflicts between <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/s/SikhIntro"> Sikh</a> and
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/mikailtariq/"> Muslim</a>
    youth. A British intelligence officer told me &quot;One of the phrases used by Muslim youth getting ready to attack some Sikh
    youths is 'We're going to knock some turbans off!'&quot; In a North London Muslim neighborhood I observed a gang of Sikh youth as they
    destroyed public property walking down the main business district at one
o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>The officer also said Sikh youths in London &quot;are middle-class and use their parents' nice cars to do
    'drive throughs.'&quot; The British use that term in the same way
    Americans use &quot;drive-bys.&quot; He told me &quot;Sometimes there are shootings, other
times the youths arrive en masse, jump out of their cars, and do considerable vandalism to private and public property.
They use bats and hammers and bash everything in sight.&quot; That's what I saw
them doing in North London.

Streaming occurs when
&quot;Groups of gang youth hop on an underground carriage [subway car] and, timing their movement to when
the carriage will make its next underground station stop, run through one carriage, into another, and so on all the while grabbing necklaces, watches,
purses, computers, backpacks, suitcases and anything else of value. It is a very popular activity at several underground
[subway] stations. But, it's no longer restricted to the underground. Gangs of youth are also committing this act on the streets of
London on buses.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">&quot;When it is properly organized, as many
as thirty youth will be involved. Outside the car, all during that
time, are several enforcers from the group who are there to make sure nothing goes wrong - like some citizen or undercover
cop getting in the way and trying to be a hero. We do have streaming gangs.&quot;</font></b></p>

            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">One year later, while riding a
            bus from the Las Vegas Strip to the downtown casinos, I watched in
            amazement as a man entered the front of the bus at one of our stops.
            He immediately ran toward the rear door grabbing everything of value
            in sight. He exited the rear of the bus before the driver could close the door and
            trap him inside. I asked the driver why he didn't close the door. &quot;This happens all the
            time,&quot; he said. &quot;Our policy is to let them
            go rather than trap them inside the bus.&quot;</font></b></p>

<p>The youth or street gangs of today are different in several ways from gangs
in the past. Today's gang members are more involved in illegal drugs, commit more crimes, more violent
    crimes, and use more deadly weapons in the commission of those crimes.</p>

<p><b><font size="2" color="#FF0000">Field Note: </font><font size="2" color="#0000FF">I suggested to
a British intelligence agent that one of the more significant
differences between the gang situation in the United States and England may be the presence of guns in the
hands of gang members in the United States. [Guns are difficult to acquire in
the United Kingdom.]&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">
 He said &quot;More and more
guns are finding their way into Britain. While the Sikhs and Muslims don't normally use guns in
committing their acts of violence against one another, it is not uncommon for guns to be involved
in Jamaican gang activity.&quot;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">He told me about the Vietnamese gangs in England.
&quot;They do 'choppings,'
wherein the victim is attacked using meat cleavers. They are butchered, but not sufficiently enough to cause death. One common blow is to chop through the
foot between the big toe and the next toe straight through to the ankle. The more butchering or chopping they do 
reflects the extent to which the victim initially disrespected the Vietnamese attacker.&quot;</font></b></p>

<p align="left">Gangs, due to their involvement in criminal activity, are a major threat to communities across the United States,
as well as in other nations where they are found. While the precise
extent of victimization caused by gang members is inestimable, it is clear that
it is substantial in both monetary terms and in the pain and suffering they
inflict upon their victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Like the crimes they commit, gangs are ever changing. The
fluidity of gangs is the next topic of consideration.</p>
