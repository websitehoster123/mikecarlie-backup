    <p>In addition to cities or neighborhoods in which gangs and gang members 
    are declining in number, there are three primary types of gang cities: gang free cities, those with an
    emerging gang situation, and chronic gang cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">1. Gang free cities:</font><font color="#800000">
      </font> </b>Gang free
      cities report having no gangs. They may have no gangs or they may
      have gangs but the gangs are not recognized as such by residents and local
      authorities.&nbsp; Another possibility is that the residents and police
      are in denial and refuse to report the presence of their gangs so their
    communities appear in
      national surveys as gang free cities.</p>
    <p>The majority of communities in the United States report having no gangs.
      <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Egley2000">Egley</a>,
      2000)&nbsp; </font>In a gang free community a new gang can operate without being easily
      recognized by the police, school authorities, or others. They may,
      instead, be identified as &quot;just a few kids being kids.&quot;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">2. Emerging gang cities:</font><font color="#800000">
      </font> </b>Communities
      with an emerging gang problem have not had gangs in the distant past and
      began experiencing them within the past 20 years. The gangs are not yet <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#entrenchment">entrenched</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are emerging gang communities and neighborhoods which recognize the
    gang situation they have and are taking action to reduce it. Unfortunately,
    there are many other emerging gang cities in which most residents remain in denial by viewing their gangs
      as imports. By believing this, residents and police can reject the notion that they have gangs.
      Instead, they believe they
      have another community's gang problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In emerging
    gang communities, everyone - not just
    the police - needs to be educated as to what a gang member looks and acts
    like as well as what it is that constitutes a gang.&nbsp;Early detection and
    effective action can limit the extent of gang development in these
    communities.</p>
	<p>Howell and Egley <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#HowellEgley2005">2005</a>)
	</font>provide a very helpful analysis of emerging gangs in small towns and 
	rural counties:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Your community is not alone if 
		you have an emerging youth gang problem.&nbsp; Many small towns and rural 
		areas are experiencing gang problems for the first time.&nbsp; In other 
		communities, local observers jump to the mistaken conclusion that gangs 
		are present.&nbsp; This may occur because small groups of delinquents are 
		very common, even in the smallest communities.&nbsp; Adolescents enjoy 
		hanging out together, and the reality is that juvenile delinquency is 
		often committed in groups.&nbsp; The visibility of these groups in shopping 
		malls and on street corners and their frequent troublesome behavior may 
		suggest gang involvement.&nbsp; Another factor that may lead to the mistaken 
		conclusion that a gang problems exists is the recent transfusion of gang 
		culture into the larger youth culture.&nbsp; Certain clothing styles and 
		colors commonly worn by gang members have become faddish in the popular 
		youth culture.&nbsp; One need only watch MTV for a short period of time to 
		see the popularity of what once were considered exclusively to be gang 
		symbols.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">Even if the local youths are 
		displaying gang symbols such as the colors of big city gangs, this alone 
		does not necessarily signify a genuine gang problem.&nbsp; Local groups of 
		youths often imitate big city gangs, generally in an attempt to enhance 
		their self-image or to seek popularity and acceptance among their 
		peers.&nbsp; Furthermore, although community officials and/or residents may 
		encounter episodic or solitary signs of gang activity in an area (e.g., 
		graffiti, arrest of a nonlocal gang member, and other isolated 
		incidents), absent further conclusive and ongoing evidence, this is not 
		necessarily indicative of an “emerging” gang problem that is likely to 
		persist.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2">In most cases, the gang problem 
		is short-lived and dissipates as quickly as it develops.&nbsp; Most often, 
		this is mainly because small towns and rural areas do not have the 
		necessary population base to sustain gangs and any disruption (e.g., 
		arrest, members dropping out) may weaken the gang.&nbsp; For prolonged 
		survival, gangs must be able to attract new members to replace 
		short-term members and older youths who typically leave gangs toward the 
		end of adolescence.&nbsp; Research across a number of cities with typically 
		longer-standing gang problems has found considerable movement in and out 
		of gangs:&nbsp; approximately half of the youth who join leave the gang 
		within a year.</font></b></p>

    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a name="entrenchment"></a></font><font color="#0000FF">3. Chronic gang
      cities:</font><font color="#800000"> </font></b>Chronic gang cities are characterized as having well
      established gangs - even 
    <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#entrenchment">gang
      entrenchment</a>. Chronic gang communities have long recognized and
      acknowledged the presence of gangs and find it difficult, if not
    impossible, to rid
      themselves of them. In fact, some social institutions, such as government,
    may find itself in cahoots with gang members and, in a roundabout way,
    support them, albeit not their criminal activity.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>A symbiotic relationship develops between politicians
      and gangs in certain low-income communities, particularly those in the
      process of considerable demographic or political change. Political
      aspirants who have a weak base of support and who are short of manpower
      sometimes call on youth gang members to perform a variety of tasks needed
      to compete in local politics. These tasks include obtaining signatures on
      petitions, putting up or tearing down election posters, browbeating
      voters, and getting votes out to the polling place.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Gangs are used by a variety of organizations at times
      of urban or organizational disorder to try to control disruption or the
      outbreak of a riot, and thus to stabilize volatile community situations. Gangs and gang members have received income, acceptance, status, and
      occasionally a limited degree of influence for their services. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#SpergelCurry1994">Spergel
      et al.</a>, 1994, p. 4)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The level of tolerance of police,
    judges, juvenile officers, and probation/parole officers for gang activity
    in gang entrenched neighborhoods has risen in
    response to overwhelming gang activity. It were as though an attitude of
    &quot;If they aren't killing one another and innocent people, don't
    call&quot; because there's enough murder, rape, and other significant
    criminal activity to keep all the justice practitioners busy for years.</p>
    <p>The message, however, is that a certain amount of drug dealing, theft and
    other criminal activity will be tolerated. If not tolerated, at least
    offenders know the worst consequence for getting caught is a night or two in
    jail or a month or year on probation. In effect, everyone is involved in the
    gang activity through default. The situation is tolerated and, therefore, entrenched.</p>
    <p> Denial of a gang presence in a chronic gang city is rare, although there
    are
      neighborhoods outside the chronic gang neighborhoods where residents deny
    the existence a gang problem. And, as is true in many cities, they may be
      right - at least there are no gangs in <i>their</i> neighborhood, but there
      are gangs in nearby neighborhoods.</p>
    <p>Recent studies have shown the length of time a person remains in a gang
    may be related to whether the city has a chronic gang presence or an
    emerging one.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Studies of established gangs in chronic gang cities

	<p>The reason for putting forth Spergel's typology of gang cities is to lay the foundation for the notion that communities, 
	regardless of the country in question, need to configure their approach to gangs to be
    consistent with the type of gang community they are experiencing. <i>Gang-free neighborhoods need to focus on prevention</i> while 
	<i>emerging and chronic
    gang neighborhoods should support prevention programs</i> (to keep non-gang youth
    from joining the gangs) <i>and offer intervention and suppression
    programs</i>.</p>
	<p>It should be remembered, however, that suppression (arrest and 
	incarceration) alone is not 
	sufficient - although it is an integral and important part of any approach 
	to the gang phenomenon. Treatment following suppression should be pursued, even for the 
	most hard core gang member. Many of the hard core gang members I spoke with 
	did not want their little brothers or sisters involved in gang activity. 
	That is, the hard core gang members knew it was a hard life and, in the end,
