Kinds and Names of Gangs</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Kinds of Gangs</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">The world of gangs is very complex. I didn't expect to find 
    that. When someone mentioned the word <i>gang</i> to me before I did my 
    research, it conjured up images of a group of young men standing on a street corner at night 
    selling drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">In reality, there are many kinds of gangs in the United 
    States and elsewhere. They may be categorized in several ways: by their 
    degree of organization (from loosely organized street gangs to highly 
    organized crime units such as the Mexican Mafia and Sicilian Mafia); 
    location (i.e., street gangs, prison gangs); nation (i.e., Bloods and Crips, 
    Gangster Disciples, People, Folk, and Mexican Mafia); mode of transportation 
    (i.e., car clubs, biker gangs); or longevity (i.e., generational); to name a 
    few.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Another way in which to categorize gangs is by the ethnicity 
    of their members and may include Latino gangs,&nbsp;Asian gangs, and gangs 
    composed of people from countries such as Somalia, Russia, Kosovo, Jamaica, 
    China, Japan, Laos, Cambodia, Korea, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Ghana, 
    Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, Viet Nam<font size="2">,</font> and nearly as 
    many more as there are nationalities on the planet. There are even gangs or 
    near-gangs in other countries which would be best classified by their 
    religion or faith.</p>
    <p align="left">According to Jerome Skolnick, a distinction could also be 
    made between neighborhood-based gangs and entrepreneurial gangs. 
    Neighborhood-based gangs are a more traditional type of street gang and are 
    turf oriented. Protecting the '<i>hood</i> (neighborhood) is a primary goal, 
    as is socializing. Entrepreneurial gangs are oriented toward the commission 
    of criminal acts for profit. Skolnick believes some neighborhood gangs are 
    developing into entrepreneurial gangs.
    <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Skolnick1995">Skolnick</a>, 
    1995)</font></p>
    <p align="left">Gangs may also be categorized by the kinds of crimes their 
    members commit. The most commonly used distinction is between street gangs 
    and drug gangs. Table 1 (below) illustrates the differences between these 
    two kinds of gangs according to research conducted by Malcolm Klein. <font size="1">

    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Although many communities have gangs that 
    bear the names of earlier gangs that originated in Los Angeles and Chicago, 
    the actual membership of these newer gangs is often locally based and has 
    little or no real national affiliation. These hybrids - new gangs that may 
    have the names but not the other characteristics of older gangs - are one of 
    the new types of gangs most frequently found in communities that had no gang 
    culture prior to the 1980s or 1990s.</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Starbuck2001">Starbuck</a>,

    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">With an estimated 840,000 gang members in the United States 
    one should not be surprised there are thousands of gang names being used. 
    Some gang's names are a mixture of neighborhood identifier and nation. For 
    example, the 14th Street Bandilleros (fictitious) are, as evidenced by their 
    name, claiming to be in the nation of Bandilleros but are the 14th Street 
    set.</p>
    <p>So, what is a <i>set</i>? I am from the state of Missouri. Everyone in 
    Missouri may be called a Missourian but when asked where they come from, 
    they often say the name of the city in Missouri from which they come. I am a 
    native St. Louisan. In gang slang, St. Louis would the set I belong to in 
    the larger gang known as the Missourians. By analogy, a person may be a 
    Bandillero but, as in our example, he will claim to be a <i>14th Street</i> 
    Bandillero.&nbsp;The 14th Street designation is his <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Sets">
    set</a>&nbsp;within the larger group of Bandilleros.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There may be thousands of sets within a nation of gangs (i.e., Crips, 
    Bloods, Gangster Disciples, or whatever nation) and anywhere from one to 
    hundreds of sets in one city or another. Set members tend to name themselves 
    according to the names of the streets on which their founder or several of 
    their members live, or the name of their local neighborhood, parks, schools, 
    or other landmarks in their vicinity. Some gangs have no such territorial 
    ties and name their gangs using other rationales. The derivation of some 
    gangs' names are unknown, even to some of their members.</p>
    <p>Before I began my research I thought each nation (Bloods, Crips, etc.) 
    got along with their own members, knew one another, and were of the same 
    cloth, so to speak - shared the same rules, goals, and beliefs. Instead, 
    sets in the same nation may or may not get along with one another, seldom 
    know one another, and seldom share the same rules, goals, or beliefs.</p>
    <p align="left">The name of a &quot;nation&quot; in association with the name of a 
    local gang may have nothing to do with that nation. For example, the use of 
    &quot;Crip&quot; after a local gang name (the name of the set) does not mean that the 
    members of that gang know any of the other Crips in another city, although 
    they may know some of the Crips in other local Crip sets. And they may or 
    may not get along with other sets of Crips.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>It is important to note that when a gang 
      has taken the name of a nationally known gang, this does not necessarily 
      indicate that the gang is part of a group with a national infrastructure. 
      According to the NDIC [National Drug Intelligence Center] Report the 
      majority of gangs do not have interstate connections or a hierarchical 
      structure. These loosely structured gangs are often more violent and 
      criminally active than the gangs they seek to imitate.</b></font><font size="1">

    gang members, use of symbols and colors from multiple - even rival - gangs,

    <p align="left">While the general public may hold a stereotype of gangs as 
	being like those in California (i.e., Bloods and Crips), the fact is that 
	the nature of the gang phenomenon varies from one community or neighborhood 
	to another. To effectively address a neighborhood's gang problem it must be 
	studied so that its exact nature is well understood.</p>
	<p align="left">Regardless of the kind of gang or its name, researchers have 
    found many of them have a culture of their own - a subculture within 
    society's larger culture, if you will. Gang culture is our next topic of 
    discussion.</p>
