            Sisters. She described them as &quot;a very tough and violent gang of about twelve African-American
            girls. The members of the Sisters were all alike - same hairdos,
            same clothes, same makeup, same walk. The girls got together
            in junior high school. I think they're tougher than male gang
            members.&quot; Marsha was referring to how the girl gang
            members intimidate and interact with other people as compared to the
            male gang members with whom she works.<br>
            <br>
            Every now and then Marsha saw members of the
            Sisters standing around after school as they watched other girls
            participate in Double Dutch - jumping two skipping ropes
            alternately. After a few weeks of this, Marsha introduced some
            of the Sisters to the sport and was eventually successful in altering their
            behavior [becoming less involved in deviance and criminality].</font></font></b>
            </p>
            <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">Marsha told me the Sisters enjoyed
            playing together at Double Dutch and enjoyed its physical and
            competitive nature. They formed a team
            and, in time,
            began to win trophies and traveled extensively to
            compete. According to Marsha, &quot;Most of the Sisters are married now.
            They're mothers, employed, and no longer in trouble with the
            law.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Marsha also got the Sisters interested in 4H
            activities. She took members of the gang to visit farms. She said &quot;They saw things they would never have seen
            where they lived in the inner-city. The new experience,
            the things they saw, and the fact that someone cared enough to share
            this experience played a role in changing their attitudes,&quot;
            which, Marsha believes, led to positive behavioral changes.<br>
            <br>
            She said &quot;Just showing them another way of life

    <p align="left">There is growing interest in female gang members among gang researchers and those who want to provide prevention and
    intervention programs for them. Their concern is
    well taken as the participation of females in gang activity appears to be increasing in some jurisdictions.
    Much of the evidence for this is anecdotal since collection
    of data from the police is somewhat skewed. Police, and the courts,
    are less likely to attribute gang membership to females which may result in an under reporting of their participation in gangs.</p>

    <p>We need to be concerned about young girls and
    gangs. Since they serve a purpose in male-dominated gangs, they will
    be sought out for membership or association in a gang. And there are young
    girls forming their own gangs - for profit, for protection, and for other
    reasons as well. Once in a
    gang, their behavior becomes more like the male gang members' behavior.
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Dana Nurge, an assistant professor at
      Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice, has interviewed
      school administrators, street workers, law-enforcement officials, and
      female gang members about the growth of girl gangs. Today's female gangs,
      Nurge reports, may evolve from informal cliques -- whose criminal activity
      is limited to petty theft and assault -- to more-structured organizations
      that adopt traditional male-gang attributes such as colors, tattoos, hand
      signals, initiation rituals, oaths, and regulations. Although girl gangs
      shy away from such male-gang trademarks as graffiti and gunplay, police
      say, they do deal drugs, beat people up, and carry weapons -- especially
      knives, razors, and bleach spray bottles, which they use like mace.</font></b><p><font size="2"><b>'Make no mistake, these girls are not girl

    <p align="left">While only a minority of gangs are female dominated, most
    male-dominated gangs have some role for women to play. They may
    be used as sex objects by the male members and/or as accomplices in crimes the males commit. As sex objects, they are used to satisfy the
    sexual urges of male gang members and as a means for proving one's
    manhood. Initiation ceremonies for some females include being
    &quot;sexed in&quot; - a process which requires the female to have
    intercourse with one or more of the male gang members. The use of the females as
    sexual objects varies according to the type or ethnicity of the gang.</p>
    <p align="left">Using female gang members as accomplices in crime was
    clarified for me as I observed females carrying drugs for male gang members
    in the process of selling those drugs. Once the male gang member and
    the drug buyer had negotiated a deal, the female brought the drugs to the
    transaction and handed them to the buyer. The male gang members
    involved in these transactions did not touch the drugs. This was done so that, if caught, the male gang member could disavow any
    wrongdoing. The reasoning for this behavior is that if
    a female is caught in a drug deal, she will not be dealt with as harshly by
    the police or courts as would a male caught in the same
    situation. The same scenario was revealed when it came to
    carrying guns.</p>
    <p align="left">The <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/jjbul2001_3_3/page4.html#drug_dealing">crimes
    in which most female gang members participate</a> are either violent crimes
    or drug offenses. According to Moore and Hagedorn <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FemaleGangs">2001</a>)</font>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="2">Many, but not all, female gang members are
      involved in some kind of delinquency or criminality. Youth surveys
      consistently show that delinquency rates of female gang members are lower
      than those of male gang members but higher than those of non-gang females
      and even non-gang males. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">In general, female gang members commit fewer violent
      crimes than male gang members and are more inclined to property crimes and
      <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Status">
      status offenses.</a></font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Some might conclude from these data that female gang
      members are not violent enough to be of concern. However, an 11-city
      survey of eighth graders undertaken in the mid-1990s found that more
      than 90 percent of both male and female gang members reported having
      engaged in one or more violent acts in the previous 12 months.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="2"> The researchers found that 78 percent of female
      gang members reported being involved in gang fights, 65 percent reported
      carrying a weapon for protection, and 39 percent reported attacking
      someone with a weapon. These and similar findings prompted the authors
      of this study to recommend that gang prevention and intervention efforts
      be directed specifically at females. </font></b><a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FemaleGangs"><font size="1">(Moore

    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Male Gang Members'
    Perceptions of&nbsp;Females in
    Gangs</font></b></p>
    <p>One of the clearest statements about how male gang members perceive of
    females in gangs was written by Moore and Hagedorn <font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#FemaleGangs">Moore
    and Hagedorn</a>, 2001, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/html/ojjdp/jjbul2001_3_3/page3.html">page</a>)</font>.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">In Los Angeles, a large random sample of male and female Mexican American
    gang members was asked about the role of women in the gang. Half of the male members claimed that female members
    were 'possessions.'&nbsp; This response not only referred to the females
    sexual exploitation but also reflected the males general need to be in
    charge. The other half of the male members felt that female members were
    respected and treated like family. (About two-thirds of the female members
    vehemently denied that they were treated like possessions.)</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">In San Antonio, where there are many Mexican American gangs but few
    female gangs or gang members, most females who associate with male gang
    members are respected. But 'hoodrats' - females involved in 'frequent
    partying, drug using, participation in illegal activities and multiple
    sexual encounters' - are not deemed worthy of respect.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Although male gang members may exaggerate their sexual domination over
    female members, there are reports from females that they have been sexually
    exploited by males within the gang.&nbsp; In San Francisco, females from an
    immigrant Salvadoran gang reportedly often were sexually victimized by male
    gang members, although this rarely happened in a nearby Mexican American
    gang.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Sexual abuse and exploitation by male gang members were also reported by
    some subsets of female gang members in Columbus, OH; Phoenix, AZ ; Chicago; and Los Angeles.
    (All of these studies involved African American, Mexican American, and
    Puerto Rican females.)&nbsp; Some of these reports may have been from females who were only
    marginal to the gang.&nbsp;</font></b> </p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>In Milwaukee, for example, females controlled admission to their gang (a
    female auxiliary to the male gang), but female wannabes seeking to
    become members thought that males controlled admission.&nbsp; The male
    members tricked some female wannabes into group sex by telling them it was
    an initiation ritual.&nbsp; It was not, and females who participated in the
    group sex did not become members of the gang</b></font><b><font size="2">.&nbsp; A similar situation existed in Phoenix.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Evidence of sexual exploitation of female gang members at home and within
    their gangs is one reason for considering female gang membership a serious
    social concern.&quot;</font></b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This brings us to a consideration of the racial and ethnic composition of
    gangs.</p>
