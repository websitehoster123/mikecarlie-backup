    <p>Before conducting my research on gangs, I hadn't given much thought as to
    whether it was easy or difficult to get out of a gang. From what I've
    learned, it depends upon the situation. There are gangs which are nearly
    impossible to leave alive and others one may leave with less serious

    <p> Chaiken studied gangs in three neighborhoods in inner-city Washington,
    D.C. &quot;Consistent with
    findings in other cities, [her] study showed that gang membership in the
    three neighborhoods examined lasted a relatively short time (between 1 and 2
    years)&quot; <font size="1"> (<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Loeber1996">Loeber,
    Huizinga, and Thornberry</a>, 1996).</font> Regardless of Chaiken's findings, getting out may not always be an easy
    thing to do.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Interviews with current and ex-gang members describe
      different situations under which members left the gang. Some ex-members
      were jumped-out, or beaten-up in order to receive the gang's permission to
      exit. More often, various ex-members reported that they gradually stopped hanging
      out with the gang and found new friends or pursued new interests.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>However, for some members, leaving the gang may be
      more difficult, due perhaps at least in part to the perceptions of police
      or court officials and rival gangs. A member may attempt to leave the gang
      but be unable to do so when threatened by rival gangs, who may not know or
      care about the youth's attempt to end his gang involvement. That youth may
      be forced to continue gang associations to protect himself from rival
      gangs. If a youth is viewed by police or court officials as a gang member,
      that label may make changes in behavior that indicate the youth has left
      the gang. Such a label may also limit a youth's educational or employment
      opportunities, encouraging him to remain in the gang when he is actually
      looking for a way out. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Baba2001">Baba</a>,

    <p> I interviewed several gang members who felt they had to leave their
    hometown to escape from the gangs they had joined. The transition has
    not been easy for them due to the mobility of the other gang members
    and their contacts in other cities. They fear a member of their gang will
    find them. They also find it difficult to live with the fact that they can never go home again or, if they do, that they will always be
    looking over their shoulders to make sure they don't get caught or hurt by a
    former gang member or rival.</p>

      leave the gang. Seizing opportunities when gang members have

    <p align="left">It has also been reported that &quot;'peripheral' or
    'fringe' members found it easier to leave the gang than did 'core'
    members. It was more difficult for core members to leave the gang
    because of their increased involvement in gang activities and subsequent
    dependence on the gang for social support and other benefits.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Horowitz1983">Horowitz</a>,

    <p align="left"><a name="Robbie"></a>I encountered several gang members who got out of their gang
    through faith. Among the kinds of people who assisted them were local faith
    leaders, police, probation and parole officers, and community activists. Robbie's story is a good example of this.
    He was a Caucasian member of the Gangster Disciples and was 30 years of age
    when I interviewed him. He first involvement in a gang took
    place when he was fourteen.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>Robbie's Story</b></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="2">(&quot;Robbie&quot; is a fictitious name
      and the names of the cities in the story have been changed to protect his
      identity. He was, in fact, a Gangster Disciple gang member.)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Robbie originally moved to San Antonio from Denver to get away
      from drugs and his gang, the Gangster Disciples. He told me he had &quot;a difficult time
      adjusting to life&quot; in San Antonio. He had left home, friends, school,
      and a physical environment he knew well. Now he felt lost. After a brief
    period of time, he moved back to Denver.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Once there he tried to stay in high school but got involved with his old
      gang associates, began drinking and using other drugs, dropped out of school, began
      selling drugs again and, as he told me, &quot;hit rock bottom.&quot; He was eventually
    arrested and the police impounded his car. In his car were all of his clothes, cash, and all the drugs he was using and selling.
    In other words, he was broke.</p>
    <p align="left">His parents had moved from Denver to San Antonio to be near
    him. Desperate, he asked his parents if he could live with them.&nbsp; He had to ask several different times since, each
      time he called and asked, they said &quot;No.&quot; They had had
      enough of his gang activity and involvement with the police.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, his parents agreed to take him back because he promised he
      would change. He came back and, in only two months, was
      caught by undercover police when he sold them some crack cocaine. He also
    had one and one-half pounds of marijuana in his
      possession. He told me that his &quot;life had reached a new low, and it didn't seem like I was ever going to get out of this cycle I was
      in.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">For the next several years he was in and out of jail and
      prison. During one of those stays he met
      an inmate who was reading a bible. After observing the inmate for a
      few days, he said, &quot;I was simply drawn to him one day. I
      don't know what it was, but I had to talk with him about what he was doing.
      That inmate gave me a bible and told me to spend some
      quiet time in my cell and to start reading it. I eventually gave myself to God and
      my life has been different since that day.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I prayed for things, for the help of others, for God's help. And I
      was amazed how things began to turn around in my life. In
      court, so many people came to speak on my behalf. Police
      officers and my probation officer knew that I was working hard to change,
      and they told that to the court. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;I was shocked when the judge reduced my
      $100,000 bail to O.R. [release on his own recognizance - he was to watch
      himself and return to court when called to do so]. Then, when I
      returned to court and pled guilty, the judge, after reading about fifteen
      letters of character reference about me written by people who were
      standing behind me, gave me a prison sentence. Then he
      suspended the sentence and, in its place, gave me probation. I was
      shocked!<br>
      <br>
    &quot;While I was on probation a county sheriff took me under his wing and helped
    me understand my relationship with God and other people. Without his
    support, I don't know if I would have made it to where I am today. I'm married
    now and, after my daughter was born, it
      was easier to get out of 'the life.' And I can't let down the people
      who supported me in court. And I can't let my wife and daughter
      down.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Robbie has been under some pressure since that time due by death threats
      made by his old gang members who think, because he has left the life, he
      has been informing on them to the police. He sees some of them from time
    to time, but hasn't been attacked. He now is a regular on
      the talk circuit in San Antonio, sharing with middle- and high-school kids the
      perils of getting involved with gangs and drugs.</p>
