    <p align="left">Although street gangs are not new, some of the legislation
    developed in the United States to deal with their members' acts of
    delinquency and crime is. Legislation creates law which is an
    instrument used by the justice system in an effort to control law violators.
    What we'll focus on here is how legislation
    over the past twelve to fifteen years has been used to control certain
    behaviors of gang members.</p>
    <p align="left">Any legislation which attempts to deal with gangs must, first
    and foremost, define what a gang is. This has not been an easy thing
    to do and there are several different legal definitions of a gang. The
    definitions are also in a constant state of flux - much as is the
    gang situation itself.</p>

    <p align="left">There is no universally accepted definition of a
    gang. While some states, as in the example of Tennessee above, are
    very specific in defining what a gang is, other states have found that making the definition too
    specific works to their disadvantage. In California, for
    example,&nbsp;the definition of a gang included identifiers such as the wearing/displaying of
    certain colors, tattoos, and/or throwing of hand signs.</p>
    <p align="left">The problem was that gang members became knowledgeable as to how the law reads and stopped using colors, didn't get tattooed or had
    old
    tattoos removed. When arrested committing gang-related crimes,
    prosecutor's were unable to prove the suspects were gang members because they
    didn't fit the definition of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">For that reason, and others, gang legislation is once again
    changing and becoming less specific. The term
    &quot;gang&quot; may eventually be defined as <i>a group of two or more individuals who
    share an on-going relationship and support one other, individually or
    collectively, in the recurring commission of delinquent and/or criminal acts</i>. References to a common identifier
    (i.e., gang name, tattoos, colors, graffiti) may be omitted.</p>

    behavior which is being criminalized while the second establishes
    punishments which may be imposed by the court on a person found guilty of
    violating the law. Both the nature of the gang-related behaviors being
    newly defined as criminal and their associated punishments are what gang legislation is all about today.</p>

    <p align="left">As mentioned <a href="GANGS/crimes_gangs_commit.htm">previously</a>,
    gang members are involved in a wide range of delinquent and criminal
    activity. Towards that end, <i>all</i> existing laws pertaining to
    crimes against persons and property may be used in an effort to control gang
    member activity.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Existing laws in most jurisdictions ... may
    allow more options for prosecuting than statutes specifically aimed at gang
    members and crimes. In Los Angeles, for instance: &quot;. . . if it is
    established that a person is a gang member (e.g., through affiliation,
    clothing, witness testimony), the policy is to seek the maximum penalty.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>
    Pursuit of the maximum penalty is guided by the beliefs that gang members
    commit a greater variety of crimes than non-gang members; gang members
    commit crimes over a longer period of time than non-gang members; gang
    members are more violent than non-gang members. </b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">Johnson,

    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">In the case of crimes against persons, laws against murder,
    rape, robbery, assault, intimidation of witnesses and victims, and extortion 
    may be used.
    Laws against
    larceny/theft, burglary, arson, auto theft, destruction of property (private
    or public), and vandalism, are among the crimes against property for which
    gang members may also be arrested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Due to the sometimes violent nature of gang activity, laws against
    carrying a concealed weapon, discharging a weapon within city limits, and
    other gun laws may be exercised against gang members whenever possible. Drug laws provide an
    additional avenue for arresting gang members who may be involved in illegal
    drug activity. This includes, but is not limited to, the cultivation,
    manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of 
    <a href="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/cntrlsub/ctlsbtoc.htm">controlled substances</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">Where a <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#Zero">zero tolerance</a>
    policy has been put into place,
    police will establish probable cause by looking for even minor offenses such as
    violating license
    and taillight ordinances, speeding, and failure to indicate a turn, to
    mention only a few. A &quot;consent to search&quot; is then likely to be requested
    so police may look for guns and contraband such as drugs and stolen goods.</p>

    <p align="left">At the same time, if there are passengers in the vehicle
    it is likely that they will also be investigated and their drivers' license numbers run
    through a criminal database such as the 
	<a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fbi/is/ncic.htm">National
    Crime Information Center</a> or the state's database. This is done to determine who the individuals
    are, to create a record of who is associating with who, if any warrants have been issued for their arrest, and to make the point
    that the police are in control.</p>
    <p align="left">Asian gang members are well known for counterfeiting charge
    cards and committing forgery in their use. Existing counterfeiting and
    forgery laws come in handy as a means of arresting them. Likewise,
    depending upon the gang's criminal activity, the police may arrest their
    members for stolen property (possessing, selling, buying, receiving),
    vandalism (useful for graffiti convictions), prostitution and commercialized
    vice, drunkenness, disorderly conduct, curfew and loitering, being a runaway,
    and other laws.</p>
    <p align="left">The point being made here is that there are already in place
    many laws which can be used to arrest gang members. What follows are other
    laws, already on the books, which may also be used to prosecute gang
    members.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">The Use of <a name="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a>, Inchoate
    Offense,&nbsp;<br>
 and Solicitation Provisions</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">
    Conspiracy refers to an &quot;agreement between two or more persons to commit an
    unlawful act.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Rush2000">Rush</a>, 2000, p. 73)</font>&nbsp;
    Because some gang crimes are committed by two or more fellow gang members
    acting in unison, conspiracy becomes a useful legal tool for the prosecution. It not only provides another law which can be used to arrest and
    convict gang members, it may also act as an enhancer and increase the length
    or severity of the sentence imposed.</p>
    <p align="left">An inchoate offense is an &quot;anticipatory offense, a
    violation consisting of an action or conduct that is a step toward the
    intended commission of another offense,&quot;<font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Rush2000">Rush</a>,
    2000, p. 168)&nbsp; </font>With inchoate offenses, suspects are
    caught in some stage of preparation for committing an illegal act. This, too, is a useful tool for prosecuting gang members caught while planning
    a criminal act.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>In addition to defining basic criminal
    offenses -&nbsp;crimes against persons, property, and public order - State criminal codes set
    forth standards for criminal responsibility and define inchoate crimes.</b></font>
    </p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Those who <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#Aid"> aid and abet</a> the commission of crimes,
    <i> even though they do not
    directly participate in the criminal acts themselves</i>, can also be held
    criminally responsible. Inchoate crimes such as attempt and conspiracy are
    punishable <i> even though the crime itself is not completed</i>. Conspiracy law
    also enables prosecutors to reach criminal conspirators <i> who are not at the
    scene of the crime itself</i>. All these factors mean that traditional criminal
    law can reach most gang crime.</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">Johnson,
    Webster, and Connors</a>, 1995, <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/pgang.txt">page</a>,
    italics added for emphasis)</font>
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Solicitation occurs when one person asks another person to participate in the
    commission of a criminal offense. When applied to gang activity it
    aids in the arrest of gang members who have asked other gang members to join them in
    criminal activity, to commit a crime in order to be accepted into
    the gang, to prove their loyalty, or for some other reason.</p>
    <p align="left">Taken together, the use of existing conspiracy, inchoate
    offense, and
    solicitation provisions expands the criminal justice system's ability to bring gang
    suspects to the attention of the court.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000"><a name="Enhancements">Enhancements</a> Made to Existing Laws</font></b></p>
    <p align="left">According to Howell,
    &quot;Innovative penalty enhancements ... provide enhanced punishment for crimes that are
    often gang related, although they are not limited in application to gang
    members. These laws not only enhance penalties against [individuals] charged
    with offenses such as drug trafficking, homicide, assault with a weapon,
    robbery, home invasion, arson, extortion, and auto theft, but also against
    accomplices charged with such offenses as conspiracy to commit a crime and
    aiding and abetting overt criminal acts.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">Howell</a>,

    <p align="left">In American criminal
    courts, guilt is determined by proving the defendant's participation in a 
    criminal act <i>beyond a reasonable doubt.</i> The level of proof needed to 
    prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is
    substantially higher than needed to prove guilt <i>by a preponderance of the
    evidence</i>. Let's take a little closer look at this important
    distinction.
    </p>
    <p align="left">Proof beyond a reasonable doubt may be defined as being
    firmly convinced that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged. It is, or
    nearly is, the removal of all doubt.&nbsp;Imagine a table supporting a weight scale 
    that has two dishes - one
    dish hanging on
    each side of the scale. The dishes are empty and perfectly balanced -
    one is as high off the table as the other. Then, during the trial, the prosecutor
    loads all of the evidence favoring conviction in one dish and the defense
    loads the other dish with all the evidence in favor of acquittal. Under the
    principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, if the dish with the evidence
    for conviction is touching or practically touching the table the accused
    should be found guilty.
    </p>
    <p align="left">Proof by a preponderance of the evidence, on the other hand, may be
    defined as &quot;Evidence that is the most impressive or convincing of any
    offered.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Rush2000">Rush</a>,
    2000, p. 259-260)&nbsp; </font>In this situation the prosecutor
    and defense load their respective dishes but they are only slightly out of
    balance. If they tip even slightly toward conviction, the accused may be convicted.
    </p>
    <p align="left">The point is that it may be considerably easier to convict a 
    suspected gang member of a crime using a preponderance of the evidence 
    rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p align="left">Enhanced legislation was developed to deal with gang-related criminality
    and <i>
    allows the use of a preponderance of the evidence</i> to show that the
    criminal act was gang-related. Having shown it was gang-related, the court
    may then <i> raise the level of punishment from a lower degree to a
    higher degree</i>. In other
    words, the use of
    the lower standard of proof makes it easier to impose the <i> enhanced</i> and
    greater punishment. That has been a notable development in
    gang-related legislation.</p>
    <p align="left">If a person is convicted of a crime, and it can be shown that the criminal
    act was gang-related, it is possible in some states to increase the level of
    sentencing <i>because</i> the act was gang-related. Not only may the degree of the crime be raised, and the
    punishment associated with its commission, it is significant to note that a <i> misdemeanor</i> conviction may, in some
    states, <i> be raised to a felony</i> conviction <i> through the use of
    enhancing
    legislation</i>. The significance of this is two fold. Felony
    convictions carry more severe penalties than do misdemeanor convictions and,
    in some states, offenders with an excess of
    felony convictions may be further penalized (as in the &quot;three strikes
    and you're out&quot; legislation).</p>
    <p align="left">Enhanced legislation is found at both state and federal levels.
    Below is an example from the State of Florida. It
    includes both forms of enhancement - raising the degree of the crime and
    elevating misdemeanors to felonies.</p>
