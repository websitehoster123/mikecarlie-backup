                when he first began working at the juvenile detention facility,
                &quot;Maybe three out of all the number of young people we had
                were Indian. Now we have Indian kids in every unit.&quot; Law

                now we have more than one gang that is strictly Native
                American.&quot; This same officer said Indian gangs are similar
                to gangs in Los Angeles and other large metropolitan areas,

                <p><b><font size="2">Indian gang members often commit crimes in
                cities and flee to tribal land to hide, a trend Indian leaders
                would like to see stopped. The Pawnee tribe created a gang
                intervention unit last spring that is the first in the Nation

                Oklahoma Gang Task Force was created with the purpose of
                educating tribes and other groups about the growing problem. An
                Indian law enforcement officer reports that 15 Indian gangs have
                been identified in Oklahoma. He states that gang members from
                Tulsa and Oklahoma City come to Indian land and recruit and sell

                children are no different from other children who have turned to
                gangs for emotional support they are not receiving elsewhere.
                Federal officials believe the Indian gang problem is not limited
                to tribes in Oklahoma, which has the largest Indian population

                a few African-American, Hispanic, and Asian residents. There
                are, according to the police, only two gangs in this town - the
                East Side and the West Side gangs. Only some of the gang
                members' names are known to the authorities. They are a mix of

                Only one police officer in the department had an interest in

                robbery. He did time and continues to be a problem in town. He
                seems to be behind a lot of drug activity in town.&quot; The
                officer told me Tory has mules (drug runners) who bring meth up
                from Mexico already cooked (processed) and ready to sell.&nbsp;<br>

                &quot;Ron is a black gang member who is known to us and to the
                community,&quot; the officer said. &quot;The crimes he and Tory
                commit include larcenies, vandalism, and drug sales. But meth is
                the primary problem drug here, and alcohol is our worst drug -
                but that's true everywhere.&nbsp;Gangs are a four letter word
