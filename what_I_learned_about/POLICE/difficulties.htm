  <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Difficulties Related to the Police <a name="Department"> Department</a></font></b></p>
  <p>While there may be other inner-departmental difficulties related to gangs,
  four appeared to me to be quite common: internal conflicts, promotions, the
  impact of when shifts are served, and how gang units measure the effectiveness
  of their efforts.</p>
  <p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Internal">Internal</a> Conflicts</font></b></p>
  <p>Difficulties in the police departments I observed ranged from the inter-personal to
  those related to policy. According to one Hispanic patrol officer,
  &quot;Our so-called Hispanic gang unit specialist is an asshole. He's
  not even Latino, he's white!&quot; That remark was representative of
  similar remarks about gang unit members dealing assigned to gather
  intelligence on specific minority gang
  members. In another community, the Asian gang specialist was a
  white man referred to within the gang unit as &quot;The White Dragon.&quot; It
  was a
  play on words referring to the fact he was Caucasian; Dragons are
  symbolic of some oriental cultures. His
  nickname in the rest of the department was less honorific.</p>
  <p>I learned that conflicting relationships between different units in the same department
  can undermine the work of a gang unit when it was on the losing end. An example of this may be found in the following
  Field Note.</p>
  <div align="center">

          I interviewed the supervisors of both the Gang Unit and the Youth
          Unit. Despite the fact that the two units are under one supervisor, I was told &quot;There isn't much communication between
          us.&quot; This was confirmed by several different gang unit
          officers later in the day.&nbsp;</font></b>
          <p><b><font size="2" color="#0000FF">I asked where the Narcotics Unit was in
          all of this and the supervisor of the gang unit replied &quot;That's a
          good question. There's a problem there, too. Narcotics is so tied up
          with going after the [drug] cartel that they won't work on
          lower level cases - like some of ours. It's all about
          money. They want forfeitures and seizures and the money they
          bring into the Narcotics Unit. If the gang-related drug case isn't big
          enough, they won't touch it.&quot;</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></td>

  <p align="left">Years of working with police has convinced me that patrol 
  officers are the key to the success of any police department's efforts. Typically the first
  at the scene of a crime, if they fail to gather
  sufficient evidence and take statements from witnesses at that time, the
  case may not make it to court - and if it does, it is likely to fail. Detectives, coming to
  a case
  much later, will have little to work with that would give the case <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#merit">
  prosecutorial merit</a>.</p>
  <p align="left">Patrol officers are often the first law enforcement officers on
  the scene of gang-related crimes. If they've been well trained in the police academy, and if the gang
  unit has had an opportunity to share its intelligence with patrol officers on
  an on-going basis, they may handle gang situations in such a way as to
  facilitate the work of the gang unit when they eventually enter the case. Matters
  can become complicated if the training and on-going intelligence sessions are
  missing.</p>

  <p>Another of the inner-departmental difficulties faced by officers in gang units was highlighted by a comment a gang supervisor made to me one evening.
  He said &quot;If you care, you get dogged -
  you know, put down by fellow officers.&quot; It makes working gangs a
  little more difficult.</p>

  <p> When promoted, it is common practice
  in law enforcement agencies to move the promoted officer to a unit other than the one in which
  he or she was serving
  when promoted. This is sometimes done to reduce conflicts which may arise within the old unit and to ensure up-and-coming command
  personnel get experience in many different units throughout the department. Depending upon
  what you believe, promotions may or may not have a
  deleterious effect on a gang unit (or any unit, for that matter).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The loss of a seasoned gang unit member, however, may also mean the loss of gang-related intelligence, valuable contacts in the community 
  and within the gangs, working relationships with other law enforcement officers, and
  more. What follows is a Field Note concerning the impact of a promotion on a gang
  unit. It speaks to a problem I saw repeated several times during the last
  three years.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Gang units which work over all three shifts (24 hours a day) are in contact with both the

  <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Measuring <a name="Effectiveness"> Effectiveness</a></font></b></p>
  <p>More and more, social agencies are expected to prove their efforts have been effective.
  Police departments are social agencies and are feeling the crunch of having to
  show whether their efforts are producing desired results. Police gang units
  have a difficult time measuring the effectiveness of their efforts. They are
  sometimes unsure of just what effect they are supposed to have and, as Howell <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">2000</a>)
  </font>reminds us, &quot;Police should not be expected to assume the sole
  responsibility for youth gang problems. Broad-based community collaboration is
  essential for long-term success.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Howell2000">Howell</a>,
  2000, p. 54) </font>One should not, therefore, expect gang activity to decline
  over the long-term just because the police gang unit officers have made a lot
  of arrests.</p>
  <p> How does a gang unit measure its
  effectiveness? One city's gang unit uses the number of
  drive-by-shootings as a measure of its effectiveness. Fewer drive-bys is taken as
  a measure of the gang unit's success. Another city's gang unit measures its effectiveness, in part, by the amount of
  graffiti being thrown up in area neighborhoods. Some use the number of
  arrests for <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#Gang-motivated crime">motive-based</a>
  offenses - a very difficult and unreliable measure.</p>
  <p>The real difficulty lies in determining what &quot;success&quot; is. Is it
  a reduction in drive-by-shootings? The number of arrests made for gang-related
  crimes? The commission of fewer gang-related felonies? Fewer calls for service
  from
  residents concerning gang activity in their neighborhoods or schools? In order to measure
  the gang unit's effectiveness the goals (outcomes) of the unit must be clearly
  articulated and measurable. Measurement of effectiveness begs the question as
  to what the mission or goal of the gang unit is. These are two of the difficulties gang
  units are facing today - <a href="purpose.htm">defining their mission</a> and
  identifying measurable outcomes.</p>
	<p>Webb and Katz report that, in the four police departments they studied, 
	officers and command personnel &quot;identified several problems with their gang 
	units. They cited shortcomings related to such issues as unit size (number 
	of officers assigned to the unit), insufficient communication, lack of 
	proactivity (very few preventive measures were taken by any of the gang 
	units studied), deficiencies in intelligence gathering, the need to 
	decentralize the unit to area command, and organizational isolation (when 
	gang units are located off-site from the rest of the police department).&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz

  <p>When multi-agency task force meetings are held, some departments failed to
  attend. Some of those who were repeatedly absent represented towns with no
  identifiable gangs - attending was not important to the officers. Others
  didn't attend because they were in denial about their community's gangs.
  Attending a task force meeting was viewed as paramount to announcing the fact
  that one's community had gangs. Some law enforcement agencies sent
  representatives who were obstructionist in their approach to the work of the
  task force or attempted to control the agenda. While most officers who participated in
  task force operations seemed to work well together, there appeared to be difficulties 
  related to
  working in a multi-agency (many different law enforcement agencies) environment.</p>
  <p>Some of the difficulties agency personnel experience in working with other 
  agency personnel has to do with claiming territory. Every agency or officer 
  wants credit for a good arrest or seizure, so a conflict may erupt over who is going to get 
  the credit. Inter-agency issues are sometimes personality-based.
  Officers from different agencies simply didn't work well together. Regardless of the source of the difficulty, if law
  enforcement officers are hindered in their work - by their own agency or others - the
  gangs win and the community loses.</p>

  <p>The most common complaint expressed by the officers I interviewed had to do
  with a lack of adequate resources for doing their job well. Like some of
  America's schools, the juvenile- and criminal-justice system in
  many areas of the country lacks sufficient funding. This results in a
  shortage of personnel and equipment when it comes
  to working gangs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font color="#008000">Having to reply upon suppression only:</font></b>
  <br>
  Gang researchers and police know a reactive-only approach to gangs will not
  reduce gang activity and youth violence in the long-term. By <i>reactive</i> I
  refer to incident-oriented policing - reacting to calls for service  when a
  crime is reported, waiting around until a crime occurs then reacting to that
  incident. Instead, a <i>pro</i>-active approach, in conjunction with reactive
  policing, is what is needed.</p>
  <p>Proactive policing supports the notion that police have a role to play in
  the community in efforts to identify the root causes of gang formation and in
  working to eradicate those causes. But in a resource-poor environment,
  proactive policing is a luxury. In fact, it's difficult enough to be
  successful at reactive policing given all the calls for service police are
  experiencing. Arrests are what most communities want to
  see, and police have to satisfy that demand. In summary, one of the difficulties of having
  too few resources is not being able to provide sufficient proactive
  policing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#008000"><b>Too few police: <br>
  </b></font>If there were  more police working gangs, we might be less likely to
  hear what one officer said when he told me &quot;The most frustrating part of
  my job is that I don't have time to work with a troubled child and his or her parents.&quot;
  Instead, gang unit officers, like patrol officers, find themselves either
  running from one gang-suspicious incident to another throughout their shift, or
  they are tied up in one incident for hours on end -&nbsp; particularly in chronic gang
  neighborhoods.</p>

  <p>Political correctness, concern with their image in the community, and
  pressure from police administrators complicate the work of police. As if there weren't already enough difficulties related to working gangs,
  the issue of racism and profiling have once again emerged. The issue is faced
  by gang units officers in the United States as well as other countries.</p>

  <p>I visited a part of London known for its Afro-Caribbean-led crack trade and
  stood in the midst of an outdoor market watching crack dealers selling their
  drugs only twenty feet in front of me. I was standing with three plainclothes officers all the while this was going
  on. About 15 minutes later we observed a white male in his mid-twenties walking
  up an exterior staircase looking as though he were smoking something. The officers immediately took off
  running after the white man. They ran up
  the stairs and caught him. As I walked up the stairs I looked down on
  one of the steps and saw a clear plastic water bottle with some aluminum foil
  wrapped around its opening. He had thrown the bottle down when he
  ran from the police.</p>
  <p>The aluminum foil had been perforated and a hole about the diameter of a
  pencil had been created in the side of the bottle. He had allegedly placed a
  rock of crack cocaine on the foil, put his lips around the hole on the side of the
  bottle, lit a match, and used the bottle as a bong (a pipe-like device used for
  smoking).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I brought the bottle to the scene where the officers were now searching a canvas athletic bag
  the suspect was carrying. We learned he was a part-time employee at a
  nearby bakery and he admitted he had just bought and smoked
  some crack. The officers cautioned him against smoking crack saying
  &quot;You know what this will do to you, don't you?&quot; They chatted with
  the man for a while then sent him on his way saying &quot;Don't
  come back here to buy any more drugs. We know who you are now!&quot;</p>
  <p>When all was said and done, I asked the officers why they pursued the
  Caucasian user and didn't do anything about the Afro-Caribbean dealers we had been watching. That's when I was told about the Stephen Lawrence case
  - an African-British man who was beaten to death by several white gang members
  in the Greater London area.&nbsp;An inquiry into how the Lawrence
  case was handled (the police apparently botched the investigation and the case
  was lost in court) resulted in a finding of incompetence and racism within the
  police department.&nbsp;The public outcry against the police from the minority community
  produced a situation in which offenders of color are now often bypassed as police
  focus their attention elsewhere.</p>
  <p>As to working in a politically charged environment, police must be
  responsive to several audiences - including the political leader of the city
  for which they work (i.e., Mayor, City Council, City Manager). These political
  figures are pressured by individual citizens and vested interest groups in
  ways which may eventually impede upon the police (usually through pressure put on
  the police administrator by the city adminstrator).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> If the Mayor, for example, is pressured by the local Chamber of Commerce to
  downplay the presence of gangs due to their potential impact on tourism and
  sales revenues, the gang unit ends up the at the brunt end of the deal. On the other
  hand, if a residents' association in a gang neighborhood gets the ear of the
  police administrator, it may be able to beef up the gang unit presence. The
  point is that much of what a gang unit ends up doing is influenced by
  politics. Few of the gang unit officers I interviewed approved of that way of
  creating their work agenda.</p>
  <p>There are also difficulties in relation to implementing gang-related laws
  in the United States. In another portion of <i>Into the Abyss </i>are examples of
  <a href="../legislature.htm"> legislation</a> directed at gang-related
  behavior. Often referred to as &quot;enhanced legislation,&quot; it provides for stiffer penalties for offenders convicted of committing
  gang-motivated or gang-related crimes.&nbsp;Police must have a well developed
  case against the accused addressing all the fine points of the law in order
  for an enhanced sentences to be imposed. That is a major difficulty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Building
  a case for enhanced punishment is not an easy task and requires a thorough
  knowledge of the law (both state and federal) and the ability to build a case
  which satisfies it. In addition, the intimidation of witnesses further
  complicates the work of police as well as prosecutors.</p>

  <p align="left">I learned it may not be easy to determine if a gang is
  present in one's community. Or, if there is a gang, it may be difficult to prove their existence
  in court or that any given
  suspect is a member of the gang. This also makes the work of gang unit officers more difficult.</p>

  <p align="left">The very nature of gangs complicates the work of the police. Where a gang has been detected, and a suppressive effort is
  carried out by the police, it is not uncommon for the gang members to move
  their operations elsewhere. The phenomenon the officer was talking about is called <a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#displacement" name="displacement"> gang displacement</a>
  - the movement of gang members and their illegal activities from one place to another.
  It solves nothing.</p>
  <p align="left"> Some gang members
  have more than one moniker or two or more gang members may have the same
  moniker. Sometimes two or more gangs in the same community have the same name,
  or a gang changes its name. That make the work of the gang unit more
  difficult.</p>

<p><font color="#000000">I asked if the Deputies in the gang unit ever talked with non-gang members in the
community, &quot;just to find out what they think is going on.&quot; I was
told &quot;If we talk with someone like that we
might be marking them for retaliation by a gang. The gangs
don't know what we're talking about and they may think the individual is ratting on
them.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p align="left">Once a gang has been discovered, there's no assurance its
  members will be living or operating in the same neighborhood tomorrow. As one gang
  unit supervisor said, &quot;The mobility of gangs makes tracking their members nearly
impossible.&quot; They change their name, switch cars, they even
  use <font color="#000000">&quot;crack rentals&quot; - renting guns, cars, and other things
  in exchange for crack. It can be a very confusing universe and can
  cripple police efforts to thwart the gangs.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Even city public transportation policies, originally designed
  to make the movement of shoppers through the city convenient and free, can
  thwart the work of the gang unit. I was told &quot;<font color="#000000">Having a free bus zone
  downtown has complicated enforcement efforts because gang
  members and their clients begin their transactions on the street, complete them on a bus then get off the bus.
  This makes observing and following them
  impossible!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Street sales, too, can be done in stages. A gang
unit officer who had years of narcotics experience in the department told me &quot;The buyer and seller agree
in one place on whether the desired drug is available, they determine how much
it costs in another place, the buyer pays for the drug in another, and gets the drug in
yet another! If this is spread across enough blocks, we can't follow them and the mobile unit can't keep up because of
difficulties with traffic.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Gangs operating in a
  neighborhood may only be there for brief periods of time, making detection
  nearly impossible. One of the gang unit supervisors told me &quot;One of our bigger problems is groups or gangs that come into town on Friday and Saturday nights and commit crimes.
  Then they go back to
  their hometown - it's only a few miles down the road. This makes it very difficult for us to do follow up
  investigations. These individuals are not known here.</font> <font color="#000000">It's almost impossible to catch an O.G. (<a href="../../Resources/glossary.htm#original">original
gangster</a>) today. They're either not in
the business any more but are teaching other people how to do the business, or they have a
group of juveniles running guns and drugs for them. We hardly
ever catch an O.G. red-handed. They have the
juveniles do the dirty work 'cause, if they get caught, not much is going to
happen to them. They're juveniles!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The supervisor's frustration was obvious as he
    described
    members of a gang who, he said, say they are &quot;Bloods or Crips,
    or half say they they're one and the other half the other. Because of this, our
    intelligence becomes outdated quickly. The point is, as the gangs
    and the gang situation changes, law enforcement has to change. At
    least that's the situation in our area.&quot;</font></p>
  <p>Some gang members talk with gang unit officers in order to rat
    (provide information) on other gangs and gang members. A Canadian gang
  unit officer mentioned this as evidence that some gang
    members are comfortable coming in to talk to his unit. &quot;The
  problem is,&quot; he said, &quot;sometimes they do this just to get rid
  of some competition on the street. They rat on someone, we bust 'em, and
  the competition is gone.&quot;</p>
  <p><font color="#000000">As if the situation weren't difficult enough already,
  among the more common expressions of the police I interviewed was &quot;This week's witness was last week's suspect
  and a victim the week before that.&nbsp; And
it's back and forth like that over and over.&quot; For hard-core gang members, I
  was told, &quot;The code of silence
  among gang members makes investigations difficult.&quot;</font>

  <p>In Seattle and Vancouver I learned that older Asians sometimes don't understand how the American system of justice
  works. They fear the police in the United States as they did in their homeland.
  For this reason they seldom call the police to report a victimization. If they do report
  a crime, they see the suspect arrested and taken to the police department.&nbsp;Then they hear that the suspect paid money to the police and was released.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> They don't know
  that the suspect is paying  bail and they don't know what the word &quot;bail&quot; means. They
  think suspects are arrested then buy their release.&nbsp;That is another
  reason why some older Asians fail to report their own victimization or that of others.
  In one community I visited, a newly
  hired Asian police officer was spending his first year on duty explaining how 
  the system works to elderly Asians and
  attempting to gain their trust and compliance in reporting crimes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Illegal immigrants from other cultures may be
reluctant to contact police in their host country because they are vulnerable to
the threat of deportation. This is a significant barrier to the work
  of gang unit officers since it stops the flow of information needed to build
  intelligence.</p>

  <p align="left">I recently attended an annual meeting of the Western Social
  Science Association. One of the categories in which presentations
  were being made was called &quot;Borderland Issues.&quot; The
  presentations dealt with conflicts taking place between people whose
  nations or regions bordered one another.</p>
  <p align="left">There are borderland areas in conflict throughout the world. The
  problem is that some people have migrated to their
  new locations and brought their borderland conflicts with them. One example of this may be found in
  the nature of relations between Hindu
  and Muslim residents in north London who, daily, see their youth in conflict
  with each other. Their conflict is, in part, an extension of the borderland conflict between
  Pakistan and India.</p>

  as differing factions wear their religious group's colors and do battle with one another.
  The borderland conflicts also express themselves when a young man from one group asks out a
  young woman from the other, or if a perceived slight or act of disrespect
  occurs. Examples of other borderland conflict areas include the United
  States and Mexico, China and Taiwan, and Laos-Cambodia-Vietnam, to name a few
