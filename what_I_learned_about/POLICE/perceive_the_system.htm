    <p>Overall, the police I observed viewed the justice system as too lenient
    and therefore ineffective as a deterrent for the offenders who pass through
    it. The most consistent concern was about how <i> juveniles</i>  were dealt
    with in the courts, particularly those who were involved in gang activity.</p>

    <p>Their concern with juveniles was related to their belief that juveniles
    treated effectively by the courts early in their lives would be less likely
    to become involved with gangs.</p>
    <p>Some expressed the belief that if police, prosecutors, judges, probation
    and parole officers, and community treatment staff would simply do what it
    is that they were hired to do, the gang situation would not be as serious as
    it currently is. The following sections speak to some of their frustration.</p>

    <p>The first contact police formally have with the courts is with
    prosecutors. They present their cases to prosecutors in hopes of being able
    to get their suspects in front of a judge. Officers working with prosecutors
    who practiced gang-related <a href="../prosecutors.htm#Vertical">vertical
    prosecution</a> expressed greater satisfaction with prosecutors and the
    courts than those working with prosecutors who simply assigned cases to the
    next available deputy prosecutor (a process called &quot;rotation&quot;).</p>
    <p>Exceptions to this finding were related to the inability of prosecutors
    to &quot;make a case&quot; using gang-related legislation. Not only are gang
    cases difficult to prosecute, the end result often produces frustration in 
    the police  who bring the cases to the prosecutor's attention in
    the first place.</p>

    <p>Officer satisfaction with a prosecutor's office appeared to be a result
    of the belief that vertically prosecuted gang members were more likely to
    face conviction and certain punishment (or treatment). In addition, using vertical
    prosecution of gang members, gang unit officers have contact with only
    certain prosecutors - the gang prosecutors.&nbsp;Being able to build upon
    this relationship appears to produce greater satisfaction among officers - they know
    which prosecutors their cases are going to, how they are likely to be
    handled, and the prosecutors know the officers better than they would under
    a rotation system of case assignment. Similarly, gang unit officers know
    which cases to avoid because they know the prosecutor probably won't take
    them to court.</p>

    <p>The following Field Note is indicative of police gang officer frustration
    from working in a rotational prosecution environment. In that setting cases
    are bandied about in the prosecutor's office and may, in the end, be lost in
    court (i.e., dismissed, result in an acquittal, end with a lenient plea
    bargain) due to the prosecutor's lack of familiarity with the case.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Losses in court produce frustration and are perceived of as insults by
    police who bring the cases to the prosecutor's office. I sometimes wondered
    how much of that frustration ended up being vented on suspected gang members
    when police encountered them on the street. On the other hand, interviews
    with prosecutors revealed their concern about gangs and frustration over
    understaffing in their offices and the sometimes incomplete or inadequately
    prepared cases brought to them by police. It takes a lot of work to build a
    solid case against a gang member - having to prove or show an act was gang-motivated
    or gang-related can be very difficult.&nbsp;The <a href="../legislature.htm">related

    sentiment was  shared by police in other units and divisions. Their
    perception was that  judges undermine the work of police  and, in effect, cause more crime to occur because offenders are not properly
    punished. They also resented the manner in which they were treated by the
    judge (i.e., being called to testify and waiting for hours only to find that

    <p>The perception (real or not) that judges are too lenient and that
    sending gang-member-suspects through the system is futile has resulted in
    police meting out street justice. That is, suspects are dealt with 
    (punished) on the
    street rather than through the courts. Disputes are overlooked, settled on
    the street, or the suspects are brought into the police station, questioned,
    held in lock-up for a while (as their informal punishment/treatment), then released.
    For some police this is a last ditch effort in hopes of resolving the
    problems gang members  present short of making an arrest and attempting to
    get the case into court.</p>

    <p>Police concern about juveniles, juvenile law, and juvenile courts is 
    understandable. Involvement in gangs often begins at an early age. It is not uncommon
    to find gang-member wannabes who are just eight or nine years old. The
    situation with juveniles today is different than it was forty or fifty years
    ago when much of the juvenile-related legislation was written.</p>

    <p align="left">Until 1899 most juveniles in the United States were treated
    as adults if they broke the law. As long as the child was over 9 or 10 years
    of age, he or she was regarded as an adult. That's a left over from our days
    as a British Colony. In 1899, however, Cook County (Chicago), Illinois,
    created the first juvenile court and defined youths 9 to 16 years of age as
    &quot;juveniles&quot; or &quot;minors.&quot; They were not to be treated as
    adults if they broke the law.</p>
    <p align="left">As noted <a href="located.htm#Sidebar">previously</a>, a new
    philosophy was created for the handling of juvenile offenders. In short,
    justice for juveniles was to take place in court privately, using informal
    procedures, and should result in efforts to reform or rehabilitate youthful
    offenders. The criminal (adult) justice process, on the other hand, was to
    be public, formal, and punitive. These differences in philosophy as they are
    applied to juvenile gang members do not sit well with some police.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Urban policing today involves a great deal of report writing. Patrol 
    officers are dispatched to an incident, study the crime
    scene, question witnesses, collect testimony, and fill out reports carefully noting
    everything he or she observed and was told. While at the scene, police are likely
    to receive another call from the dispatcher which beckons them to the next
    incident where, once again, they study the crime scene, question witnesses
    at the scene, collect testimony, fill out a report, and so it goes incident after incident, 
    day after day. At
    the end of each day, the officer is usually expected to rewrite the reports, 
    making sure they are correct in every detail, often having to input them 
    into a computer.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, gang unit officers, and officers in other specialized
    units (i.e., homicide, rape, burglary, narcotics) may have an opportunity to
    work a case from beginning (responding to a call for service like a patrol
    officer does) to end (conducting the investigation and taking the case to
    the prosecutor).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Officers in specialized units may even choose <i>which</i> cases to
    pursue and which to drop based on certain screening criteria (i.e., the
    amount or quality of evidence available, the testimony of credible
    witnesses, the seriousness of the alleged offense, the nature of the
    offender, the insistence of the victim, the political impact of the incident).
    When asked what they liked most about their work, gang unit officers often
    replied &quot;I like the autonomy - choosing the cases I want to make and
    taking them from start to finish.&quot;</p>
    <p>The perceptions gang unit officers, and others, develop are often the
    result of various difficulties they have encountered in their work. Those
    difficulties are out next topic of discussion.</p>
