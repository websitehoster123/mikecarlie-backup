    <p align="left">In the material that follows I've tried to identify the various stages through which police departments
    may pass
    on their way from denial to dealing with gangs on the street and elsewhere. They
    are presented in
    logical order. Seldom, however, does logic mimic real life. Some
    departments pass over a stage or two or move backward, particularly when a new police
    chief or sheriff enters the picture or when the gang situation in town changes.
    So, with that in mind, here
    are some of the more identifiable stages in the police response to gangs.</p>

    <p>To deny something is to refuse to accept or recognize its existence. There appear to be several reasons why a community, its police department,
    or both may deny the existence of gangs when it is clear (to some patrol
    officers, juvenile/probation/parole officers, and others close to the local
    gang situation) that
    there are gangs in the community. The following are among those reasons.</p>

      <p>During the past three years I learned that, in the United States and
    elsewhere, patrol officers are among the first to know if there are gangs on their
      beat - whether their supervisors accepted the existence of gangs
    or not. I don't mean to infer that police administrators don't know
    what's happening on the streets of the communities they serve, although that
    is sometimes the case. Rather, it's the politics
    of publicly recognizing the existence of gangs which keeps them in what
    appears to be denial.</p>
      <p>For the sake of expediency, it is easier to deny the presence of gangs
      and gang members than it is to recognize their presence and have to deal
      with the political fallout of that decision. The ramifications of having
      gangs include, but are not limited to, a loss of revenue from tourism,
      heightened fear among the citizenry, and displeasure with the police if the
      problem doesn't go away.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">B. Downward Comparison</font></b></p>
      <p>One of the more common ways to maintain a state of denial is to use downward
    comparisons such as &quot;Yeah, we have gangs, but it's nothing like what
            they have in L.A.!&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;We used to have gangs, but we took care of that.
      What
            we have today is not nearly as serious.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

            worse than it is here. But we <i>do</i> have a gang problem! But not
            according to him. He doesn't see our problem as worth any

      <p>The use of downward comparisons is, in effect, a rationalization. While accepting
      that gangs are present in the community, a person can downplay the significance
      of that fact by believing the problem isn't significant enough - the problem isn't as
      serious as it is &quot;over there.&quot; The most common reply I received when police and non-police were
    interviewed about whether their community had a &quot;gang problem&quot; or
      not was &quot;Not really. It's nothing like what they have in L.A.&quot;</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">C. Failure to Recognize Gangs</font></b></p>
      <p>Denial may also be the result of a failure to recognize
      a group of individuals as a gang. That is, a community and police unfamiliar with
    gangs or gang members may not recognize them as a gang when they encounter them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Migrating gang members can operate in a
    community without being recognized. Local gang members can also
    escape detection for a time - especially if no act of violence, serious
      property damage, or notable theft is committed. The cloak of
      invisibility they wear is that they are locals - you know, just local
      &quot;boys being boys,&quot; not a gang.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">D. Fear</font></b></p>
      <p>Neighborhood
    residents often fear gangs and their members. They are intimidated by their
      very presence. One way to escape
    feeling fear is to deny the object or cause of it. This is
    another reason why some
    communities are in denial as regards their gangs. Police also fear gangs
      when they are first encountered because, like anything else, they are an unfamiliar
      and unknown entity and this fosters uncertainty. They can also be very
      dangerous.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">E. Rejecting a Negative Self Image</font></b></p>
      <p>Denial is an understandable response to the presence of gangs in a
      community. Members of a previously
    gang-free neighborhood may find it difficult to accept the fact they now
    have a gang. The word &quot;gang&quot; conjures up images of
    a failing community, poor parenting, disturbed or violent children, poverty and
    big-city problems. Denial, in this case, is the rejection of a negative
    self image.</p>
      <p>If there are youth who are socializing with one another over an extended
    period of time who are supporting one another in repeated violations of the law, it
      may be attributed to &quot;just some kids bein' kids,&quot; or &quot;just acting
      out.&quot; In reality, it would be better to inquire further to determine whether
      the group is a gang or
    not.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Typically, when the acting out continues, or escalates in seriousness or
    frequency, or when more people become involved as members or victims,
    police are forced into exploring the situation in greater depth. Over time, it becomes apparent to patrol officers that what they
    are dealing with is not just a few people acting out. It's a gang. Or it's a few gangs.
      Or it's a group of &quot;wannabes&quot; who, if left unfettered, will
      become a larger problem.<br>
    <br>
      If a police department is ready to move beyond denial, the next phase in
      their response to gangs is to accept that they are present in the
      community - or at least in one or two neighborhoods.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font color="#800000">2. <a name="Acceptance">Acknowledgement</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Acknowledgement refers to a recognition of something - in this case, a
    recognition of the fact that one or more gangs are resident in one's community.
    It is not uncommon, however, for a police department to recognize this but withhold
    the information from the rest of the
    community. I encountered this situation in several cities - some of them among
    the largest in their respective nations. Some of them among the
    smallest. The following incident exemplifies this situation.</p>

            newspapers?&quot; The supervisor replied &quot;I do that on purpose. If I were to talk about the problem with the press and give the

    <p>Several days later the gang unit supervisor told me &quot;If

    members read
    about themselves and we end up glorifying them. I'd rather
    not do that.&quot; Of course, the trade off is that the
    community is left without accurate intelligence on gangs. How can a
    community effectively participate in or support prevention, intervention, or
    suppression efforts without accurate intelligence?</p>
    <p>Acceptance of a gang presence may be a result of a drive-by-shooting or some other sensational and public gang-related act.
    Or, as a result of a continuing problem with specific youths in a particular
    neighborhood, police find they have to admit to the presence of gangs in an
    effort to get other sectors of the community involved in trying to reduce
    the gang members' activities. I found that many police departments created their
    gang units in response to situations such as these.</p>
    <p>This topic related to one of my most consistent findings - police
    openly stated that, in order for the community's gang problem to be addressed
    effectively, the entire community must get involved. &quot;We
    can't possibly handle this situation alone&quot; was a common sentiment
    shared by police at both patrol and command levels.<br>

    <p>While some police departments respond to their community's gang situation without
    studying it first, most enter a phase of intelligence gathering and analysis
    to determine where the gang problem is occurring, who the gang
    members are, what they are
    doing, where they live (or came from), what kinds
    of vehicles they drive, the schools they are attending (if at all), their
    prior criminal histories, and more. The outcome of this process then informs
    the department's response, at least initially.</p>

    The intelligence function of a police gang unit or gang-dedicated officer includes the gathering, analyzing, storing, and sharing of
    intelligence on gangs.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">A. Gathering intelligence</font></b></p>
    <p>There are a variety of ways in which intelligence on gangs may be gathered. The most common sources are gang members and their associates, girl friends,
    the parents of gang members, teachers and school security personnel,
    probation and parole officers, residents in the gang neighborhood, local
    business owners, and
    others who have personal contact with or knowledge of a gang and its members'
    activities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some police departments are able to gain intelligence from juvenile detention
    personnel and juvenile officers but this avenue is closed in states with
    privacy rules surrounding information about minors.</p>
    <p>Police also gather intelligence from one another including
    information from patrol officers - the &quot;front line&quot; of local law
    enforcement - from the
    writings of gang members (i.e., graffiti, songs, prose), professional
    articles and books on the subject of gangs, and occasionally
    from the media.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">B. Analyzing intelligence</font></b></p>
    <p>While
    intelligence on one aspect of the gang phenomenon may be of interest and of
    some value, its value is enhanced when it is cross-referenced with intelligence on
    another matter. For
    example, knowing a member from a gang in another community is in one's town
    is valuable intelligence on its own. Knowing that he or she is the
    fifth gang member from that community to appear is of even greater value.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some police departments have a unit within their organization which is
    solely responsible for the analysis of crime/gang data. Others have only one
    officer who struggles to make sense of it all. There are also
    state-wide, regional, national, and international databases on gangs and gang
    members which are used by some law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;These databases are often not used as often or as
    effectively as some police would like. Among the reasons for this are
    a lack of personnel with skills necessary to input, extract, and
    interpret the data and a lack of funds to hire such a person or purchase
    needed equipment (i.e., computers, long-distance telephone accounts, internet
    connections).</p>
    <p>Some of the gang unit personnel I interviewed had no interest in the
    databases. The databases were perceived of as a waste of time because of the
    short life-span of the information they contain (i.e., gang members move, change their
    names, change cars).</p>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">C. Storing intelligence</font></b></p>
    <p>Once
    the data has been gathered and analyzed, will it be stored on a computer or
    as hard copy? As police departments become even
    more overwhelmed with information, the way in which it is stored becomes critical.
    It need not only be stored, access to
    the information needs to be easy and immediate. Given the
    insufficient level of funding for law enforcement today, these are difficult
    goals to reach. The most common form of storage I saw consisted of Polaroid pictures
    posted in albums or pinned to bulletin boards in the gang units'
    offices. It was crude, but it was portable and readily available, unless
    there was only one copy.</p>

    <p>The most valuable storage of intelligence takes place in an individual officer's mind.
    Although this may sound obvious, this
    simple fact points to the potential negative consequences of the following
    policy. Upon promotion
    from one rank to the next it was the policy of every police department I studied to transfer
    the person being promoted to a unit other than the one in which he or she
    was serving prior to the promotion. In other words, if an officer is
    promoted while in the gang unit, he or she will most likely be transferred
    to a different unit upon being promoted.</p>
    <p>What happens to the intelligence that officer accumulated? The loss of an officer has potentially negative consequences on the
    gang unit and their day-to-day operation. I raised this concern with many of the gang unit personnel with whom I rode and
      found there were two different points of view on this matter.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The
      first recognized that the loss of intelligence, and years of
      experience dealing with gang members and the rest of the community, was a
      serious loss to the gang unit and to efforts to reduce gang activity in
      the community.&nbsp;On the other hand, some officers believed the loss of intelligence
    was, as one commander said, a &quot;momentary setback. After all, the gang situation is changing almost daily. New gangs form,
      old ones fade away, new members join, old ones are killed, move, quit, or
      get locked up. In a couple of months the entire scene may have
      changed.&quot;</p>
    <p> Promotions may also require an officer to
      leave a unit to which he or she has become attached and in which they
      would prefer to stay. But, as I was told, &quot;money talks and promotions
      walk.&quot;</p>

    <p>The sharing of intelligence is, perhaps, the most controversial aspect of
    the intelligence function. With whom should police share their knowledge of the
    gang situation? Only other gang unit
    personnel? With other police and police units in their department?
    With police in other law enforcement agencies? With the press? The community?
    With parents of gang members?</p>
    <p>Each additional level of exposure represents a challenge to a police
    department and its gang unit. As the public becomes more aware of the gang
    situation in its midst, there are concerns in some police gang units that their
    work will be made more difficult.
      </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font color="#008000">a. Within the Department</font></b></p>
      <p>More often than not, a gang unit wants to share its intelligence within
    the department in hopes that other units - patrol and narcotics, for example - will keep an
    eye out for and report related incidents/persons to the gang unit. The problem lies in finding ways to effectively and systematically
      share the intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b><font color="#008000">b. With Other Law Enforcement Agencies</font></b></p>
      <p>Sharing gang intelligence with other police
    agencies is equivalent to admitting one's community has a gang problem. As
    mentioned above,
    this can be a barrier to intelligence sharing and it's impact
    on intelligence gathering and intelligence analysis is obvious and
    disastrous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For police willing to share their intelligence there are several sources of information for
      learning how
    other law enforcement agencies are responding to their own community's gangs.
    Among them are personal contacts between gang unit
    officers and command personnel from different
    departments (this is often facilitated by the regional gang
    investigators associations).
    </p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#008000"><font size="2"><b>Since gangs do
        not exist solely within city or county boundaries, and since gang
        clashes all too frequently involve more than one jurisdiction, it helps

        jurisdictions. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JacksonMcBride2000">Jackson

      <p>They also share in-house printed and on-line reports and information
      found in <i>Police
    Chief </i>(the magazine of the International Association of Chiefs of
      Police), the Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Program, and publications made available by the National

    and the Office of Juvenile
    Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Links to all these sources of

      <p><b><font color="#008000">c. With Prosecutors</font></b></p>
      <p>Sharing gang intelligence with the local prosecutor is needed and is a vital
      part of
      law enforcement's efforts to suppress gang activity.</p>
      <p>While conducting my research I learned about &quot;vertical prosecution&quot; and its role in
      prosecuting gang members. Vertical prosecution finds the
    prosecutor who does the initial filing on a gang-related case also making the initial court
    appearance and making all subsequent court
    appearances in the case until it is concluded. This is called
      &quot;vertical&quot; prosecution because only one prosecutor handles the case from beginning to end 
      as it moves up from the police, through the prosecutor's office, and into 
      and through the court.
      This organizational style of prosecuting offenders has been used for many
      years to prosecute murderers, organized crime figures, and other special
      classes or categories of offenders.</p>
      <p>As pertains to gangs, I interviewed several prosecutors who did not follow this
      procedure for prosecuting gang members. Instead, one deputy prosecutor filed the case, another
      did some of the preparatory work on it, and yet
    another presented the case in court. This fragmented style of prosecution
      often resulted in poorly managed cases producing undesirable results in
      court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Using vertical prosecution, prosecutors gather more coherent 
      intelligence on gangs and their members and, when presenting the case in 
      court, may better educate the court (judges) about the
      local gang situation.</p>

      <p><b><font color="#008000">d. With Probation and Parole Officers</font></b></p>
      <p>Probation and parole
    officers, because of their often extended contact with convicted gang
    members, may possess valuable intelligence about them, their associates,
    activities, and the gangs to which they belong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Police also have something to offer probation and parole officers. Some
      probation/parole officers have gang clientele who are arrested while on
      probation or parole. This means the police have intelligence
    on what some of the probation/parole officers' gang members are doing, who they're doing it
    with, and where they're doing it. All of this is important
    information in the process of providing services to probationers and
    parolees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Police who are willing to share intelligence with probation and
    parole officers empower those officers in the delivery of services. Likewise, good relations between probation and parole officers and police
    means the intelligence can flow both ways, enhancing both in their
    respective positions <i>vis a vis</i> the gangs. It's a win-win

    wider public - giving the gang credibility, publicity, and recognition.&nbsp; Police in some

    involved? Are they each primarily of one race or ethnicity or

    business peacefully? What is their business?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Are they selling drugs, stealing cars, or just hanging out (i.e.,
    gathering
    semi-peacefully, drinking, socializing)? Are there only a
    few members in each gang or are there more? Are any of the gang members from
    outside the community or are they mostly locals? The answer to
    each of these questions, and many others, will determine the steps which may

    <p>The plans implemented by the departments I visited typically involved
    gathering intelligence and exercising suppression (i.e., zero tolerance
    policies and resulting arrests). In police departments which have been
    dealing with gangs for a long period of time, plans also included
    prevention and intervention efforts. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's
    Department, for example, in addition to an aggressive suppression effort,
    offers a prevention and intervention program called Vital Intervention
    Directional Alternatives (VIDA - Spanish for &quot;life&quot;).&nbsp;More
    information on it is offered under &quot;Next&quot; at the bottom of this
    page.</p>
    <p>There are several factors which may complicate the planning process.
    Among them is a change in police administrators. There are several layers of administrators
    which may oversee the operations of a gang unit. Included are the Sgt. or
    Corporal of the unit itself, and all the administrators to whom he or she
    must report including, for example, a Lieutenant, a Captain, a Major, Deputy 
	Chief and the
    Chief. A change in any one of the administrators may alter
    the nature of the plan according to that administrator's perceptions of the
    problem, abilities, preferences, beliefs, and attitudes.</p>
    <p>Anther factor which may derail or complicate the plan is political
    pressure from outside the department. The Mayor,
    City Manager/Council, influential business people, the Chamber of Commerce, and many
    others may enter the picture when a discussion of gangs emerges. The concern I heard mentioned most which impacted upon the plan of
    a police department in dealing with gangs had to do with their potential
    effect on local tourism.</p>
	<p>A significant element in planning involves organizing the department to 
	more effectively implement the plan. Will there be a gang unit (comprised of 
	more than one officer) or just one gang officer? To whom will the officer(s) 
	assigned gang duties report? That, of course, depends upon where in the 
	organizational structure of the department the gang unit is placed. And 
	where it is placed will have an impact on how the unit operates as well as 
	how it is perceived within the department and the community.</p>
	<p>According to the 2004 National Youth Gang Survey,</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Thirty-six percent of the (2,296 law enforcement) 
		agencies (that responded to the survey) that experienced gang problems 
		in 2004, including 51 percent of larger cities (over 50,000

	<p>If the unit is placed in the S.W.A.T. (special response team) or 
	narcotics units, the gang unit officers are likely to be more aggressive and 
	will be perceived as such by gang members and the public. There's a price to 
	pay for that, although there may be a purpose served as well. If the gang 
	unit is placed in the juvenile division/unit or in criminal investigations, 
	it is more likely to be able to be less aggressive (or more, when needed) 
	and will, probably, be focused upon the juvenile element of the gang 
	situation in the community. </p>
	<p>In summary, what the department learns while studying its community's 
	gang phenomenon should determine how the department organizes itself to deal 
	with it. And, as the gang situation changes, so should the way in which the 
	department is organized to deal with it.</p>

    <p>Assuming a plan of action has been created, it's time to implement the
    plan. If the police administrator, middle-management command personnel and the gang
    unit itself are in agreement with the plan, it is likely to
    succeed. This alignment, however, is not
    assured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>There are, of course, departments in which the goals are clear and
    accepted by most of the participants. In some departments the plan of action involved several different units
    (i.e., juvenile,
    narcotics, robbery) and, in some cases, the assistance of
    community-based social services, legislators, and others. The plans varied widely from one community to another, as do the problems they
    were facing (as determined by the intelligence that was gathered).<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#800000">6. <a name="Evaluation">Evaluation
    </a></font></b></p>
    <p>Evaluation here refers to determining if the plan that was developed is
    actually working. It involves studying the impact of the plan on the measures of success chosen
    during the planning process. Among many possible evaluation measures are a
    reduction in gang activity (i.e., fewer drive-bys, the appearance of less graffiti,
    fewer acts of vandalism), a reduction in the number of youths involved in gangs, or a
    lessening in the severity of the crimes committed by gang members.</p>
    <p>The evaluation process is usually on-going. That is, once in place, it is
    repeated with regularity. A plan which is successful one year may be a
    dismal failure the next due to changes on the street in the gang
    situation. In those circumstances an on-going evaluation process
    reveals when changes are needed in the plan<b><font color="#800000">.</font></b></p>
    <p>Sadly, it appears that most gang unit officers have little contact with 
	everyday citizens. Most of their time is spent with other officers in the 
	gang unit. Any time spent interacting outside that unit is typically spent 
	with non-gang unit officers in the same department and, to a much lesser 
	degree, with gang members and their parents, children, etc. If we are to 
	believe, as many police administrators tell us today, that 
	community-oriented policing is what is needed to reduce gang activity (as 
	well as other kinds of criminal activity), then we should be seeing 
	police-community partnerships. As Katz and Webb note:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="2"><b>We concluded that the four gang units that we 
		studied (Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Phoenix, and Inglewood/CA) did not 
		engage in community policing or formal problem solving; in fact, many 
		gang unit officers were unclear about exactly what those terms meant. 
		Gang unit officers tended not to enter into partnerships within their 
		communities, and they were not proactive in seeking citizen input. None 
		had used formal problem-solving strategies to plan their approaches to 
		gang-related problems.</b></font><font size="1"> (<a href="http://www.faculty.missouristate.edu/M/MichaelCarlie/Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#KatzWebb2004">Katz

	</blockquote>
	<p>My own research confirms that finding, although I observed some gang-unit 
	officers and patrol officers who were intensely interested in their 
	neighborhoods' gang problems and who did attend community meetings to hear 
	residents' concerns and to share some of what they knew about the problem 
	with the residents.</p>
	<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>A <a name="Comment">Comment</a> on Why Police 
	Gang Units are Created</b></font></p>
    <p>Katz, Maguire, and Roncek <font size="1">(<a href="../../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Katzetal2002">Katz, 
	et. al.</a>, 2002)</font>, in a comprehensive and excellent study of why 
	police gang units are created, offered three possible explanations. 
	&quot;Contingency theory&quot; hypothesizes that</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">organizations are rational entities, adopting 
	organizational structures and operation activities that are most effective 
	and efficient in achieving specific goals. (ibid, p. 474)</font></b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>According to the contingency notion, gang units are formed as a rational 
	response to increased gang activity.</p>
    <p>According to &quot;social threat theory,&quot; the second explanation, gang units 
	are formed as a result of the majority population of the community (usually 
	Euro-Caucasians) wanting to control a threatening racial or ethnic group. 
	Comparing the social threat notion to their contingency notion, the 
	researchers hypothesize that</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Social control agencies increase the intensity of their 
	crime control efforts as a result of the perceived threat of marginalized 
	populations, rather than as a result of rational considerations such as 
	increased levels of crime. The threat may be based on either political or 
	economic competition. (ibid, p. 475)</b></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Finally, the researchers suggest &quot;resource dependency theory&quot; as a 
	hypothetical explanation for the creation of police gang units. According to 
	this hypothesis, gang units are created in an effort to acquire needed 
	resources (funding, equipment, etc.). </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>...organizations must obtain resources to survive, and 
	that to obtain these resources, they must engage in exchanges with other 
	organizations in their environment. To ensure survival and the flow of 
	resources, organizations must be political in nature and adapt strategically 
	to heir environment to accommodate the interests and requirements of those 
	with the capacity to provide resources.&quot;</b></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In other words, police departments create gang units to obtain resources 
	being offered only if such a unit and a genuine gang problem exist.</p>
    <p>In summarizing the findings of their study, Katz, Maguire, and Roncek 
	found that the contingency theory was not supported by their data and that 
	&quot;Support for social threat theory is mixed.&quot; <font size="1">(ibid, p. 487)
    </font>&nbsp;On the other hand, they did find support for the resource dependency 
	explanation.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>If the resource dependency perspective is correct, then 
	those agencies receiving federal, state, or local funding to augment their 
	gang control efforts should be the most likely to have a gang unit. The 
	findings support this hypothesis, illustrating that those police 
	organizations receiving external funding for gang control efforts are 
	significantly more likely to have established a specialized police gang 
	unit. (ibid, p. 489)</b></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I would offer one additional explanation. In several of the communities 
	in which I conducted research I was told the police gang unit was created in 
	response to a specific <i>critical incident</i>. That is, one specific, 
	typically horrific gang-related act occurred which drew the attention of the 
	community, its leaders, and/or the police to the need for a specialized gang 
	unit or a specialized gang officer.</p>
    <p>In the mid-1970s the &quot;critical incident&quot; in San Francisco was an attempt 
	by three members of one Asian gang to assassinate a rival Asian gang member. 
	This took place in a restaurant in the heart of the city's Chinatown. 
	Several innocents were killed and many were wounded as the attackers used 
	automatic weapons to spray the inside of the restaurant. The community was 
	outraged and the gang unit was formed. In Mickey O'Rourke's movie entitled
    <i>Year of the Dragon</i>, one may view Hollywood's rendition of this 
	infamous gang crime.</p>
