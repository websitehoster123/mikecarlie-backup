    <p align="center"><b><font size="2" color="#008000">The gang problem is 
    rooted in the conditions of lower-class life, particularly poverty. It tends 
    to be particularly intense in certain areas where social pathologies - 
    delinquency, mental illness, public assistance, and poverty - are 
    concentrated. These conditions are all getting worse, despite programs aimed 
    at improving them. </font></b><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Robergetal2000">Roberg</a>,

    </blockquote>
    <p>I am not very optimistic about the future as regards gangs. Neighborhoods
    experiencing <a href="../Resources/glossary.htm#entrenchment">gang
    entrenchment</a> have, in my mind, the bleakest future. Neighborhoods with
    an emerging gang situation, on the other hand, may be able to do something
    constructive to reduce gang activity. Gang free communities can benefit from
    prevention programs and from closely scrutinizing families and individuals
    who are arriving from other communities.</p>
    <p>Several gang researchers have addressed the issue of gangs in the future.
    Among them are Johnson, Webster, and Connors. <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">1995</a>)</font>
    In their study of 140 prosecutors from large jurisdictions (with a
    population of 250,000 or more inhabitants) and 160 prosecutors from smaller
    jurisdictions (25,000 to 250,000 residents) they found little reason to be
    optimistic.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b> Prosecutors did not express optimism about gangs in
    the future. In their work, they have learned a great deal about gangs, gang
    members, and the circumstances that have produced them. The gang members who
    come to their attention are often far beyond the reach of social
    interventions designed to deter youths from involvement in gang or drug
    lifestyles.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Although they stated that prosecuting gangs would not completely
    solve the gang problem, they intend to pursue prosecutions as vigorously as
    possible. But as indicated by their comments on the survey questionnaire and
    in interviews, gang prosecutors consistently advocated early intervention
    with children and youths and more effective services to strengthen families
    as the best way to prevent gang crime and violence. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#JohnsonWebster1995">Johnson,

      see &quot;Conclusions&quot;)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In short, the general outlook for reductions in gangs and
    gang-related crime is poor. In fact, the opposite appears
    likely. Worsening social and economic conditions, federal roll backs
    of hard-won civil rights legislation and a potential increase in racism, and
    an expanding minority youth population, all portend a deleterious gang
    situation. Barring any major political and economic changes ... an
    increase in gangs and gang crimes seems likely.&quot; <font size="1">(John Quicker as reported in <a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Klein1995">Klein</a>,
    1995, p. 187)</font></p>
    <p>Malcolm Klein, one of America's premier gang researchers, is also pessimistic about the future of the gang phenomenon.
    Among the sources of his pessimism are &quot;a misplaced emphasis on
    networking and information sharing among enforcement agencies, the
    continuing contribution of urban decay to gang formation, and the diffusion of
    gang culture across the nation.&quot; <font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Klein1995">Klein</a>,
    1995, pp. 187-188)</font></p>
    <p>In a study sponsored by the Family Research Council and entitled <i>Youth
    Gangs: Out of Control and Getting Worse</i>, R. L. Maginnis attributes his
    pessimistic outlook to many of the factors discussed previously in <i>Into the Abyss</i>.
    His analysis of the juvenile
    gang problem concludes stating that</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>[Y]outh crime, violence, and gang involvement are
    likely to increase sharply when the large population of elementary-age
    children reaches adolescence ... Further efforts are needed to break
    the cycle involved in gang participation.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Currently and historically,
    young males commit far more crimes than other age groups. The combination of
    more chronic juvenile delinquents and an increase in violent juvenile
    offenders is complemented by an unprecedented increase in youth living with
    little or no adult supervision.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Gangs are spreading across the country and
    are not just limited to major cities. The decline of the nuclear family has prompted many children to
    join gangs to find purpose, security, and self-esteem.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>The gang culture
    gives them a sense of belonging and remakes their value system. Partying,
    fighting, and vicious gang loyalty become their main values and replace
    virtues that favor family life. </b></font><font size="1">(<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Maginnis1995">Maginnis</a>, 1995)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Earlier in <i>Into the Abyss </i> the potential <a href="../what_I_learned_about/prisons.htm#impact"> impact</a> of gang members
    paroled or released from prison was explored.
    Research has shown that their impact is basically negative - leading to
    more, not less, gang activity. Sharing what I knew about gang members
    returning from prison, I asked a British intelligence officer if he had any concerns about
    this. He said &quot;I think that is likely to happen in
    England.&quot;</p>
    <p>Although there may be additional restrictions placed upon immigration as
    a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, difficulties surrounding immigration into the United States are likely to
    remain one contributor to gang formation and gang joining among immigrant
    youth.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In an interview with the head of a European prison
    officer's association I learned there is considerable concern regarding
    the influx of immigrants from other European nations. He said &quot;Immigrants
    from Czechoslovakia,
    Russia, Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Serbia ... are going to be ... a problem.&quot;&nbsp;
    He didn't say they would necessarily form gangs, although he is very familiar with Russian organized
    (gang) crime. He believes their lack of interest in learning English will make
    integration and assimilation even more difficult and difficulties
    surrounding integration lead to other problems.</p>
    <p>A current problem, related to immigration and birth rates, and one which
    may grow in the future, has to do with the increasing number of Hispanics
    living in the United States and the language barrier which sometimes divides
    them from other Americans. The lack of Spanish speaking personnel in both law enforcement and
    probation/parole also bodes poorly for the future. In addition, the
    increasing number of Hispanics and African-Americans in the American
    population may excite white <a href="../Storage/white_supremacist_groups.htm">supremacist
    groups</a> (ideological hate gangs) to further action.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="2"><b><a href="../Storage/skinheads.htm">Skinheads</a>
      will continue to be aligned with long-established white supremacist
      groups. The Skinhead gangs will remain among the most violent groups of
      white gangs and, although small in numbers, their potential for violence
      will remain significant. They will continue to become members of organized
      white-supremacist groups and a leading promoter of hate crimes.</b></font><font color="#008000" size="1">
      (<a href="../Resources/bibliography%20of%20books.htm#Leet1997">Leet</a>,
      1997, p. 257)</font></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>I do believe that communities can make their future. They always have,
    either by design or by default. The number of gang members can be reduced as
    can the amount and seriousness of crime they commit. In order to do this we
    need to do more than we are already doing. The <i>Solutions</i> portion of <i>Into
    the Abyss</i> identifies some of the things which could be done.</p>
