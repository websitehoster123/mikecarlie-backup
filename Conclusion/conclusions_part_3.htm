    <b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Conclusions - Part 3</font></b></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000">Section II: The Community Response to Gangs</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/neighborhoods.htm">Neighborhoods and Communities</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Communities are a collection of neighborhoods. As for gangs, some
    neighborhoods have them and some do not. Understanding the dynamics of each
    teaches us a great deal about the risk- and protective factors surrounding
    gangs. Neighborhoods with a gang presence may be characterized as having
    weak social institutions.
    On the other hand, communities with robust social institutions are less
    likely to have gangs.</p>
    <p>I learned that gangs have changed the way in which tens of millions of
    Americans live, particularly those who live in neighborhoods dominated by gang
    activity. The poor quality of life and fear they and their children endure,
    coupled with an inability to afford a better housing environment, have
    destroyed hope for more than one generation of Americans.</p>
    <p>That is what is happening whether the folks living on the &quot;good
    side&quot; of town know it or not and even if the police chief is in denial. Gangs are extracting an enormous
    toll - committing crimes, instilling fear, and costing billions of dollars in
    control efforts (i.e., for law enforcement, incarceration and treatment, drug-related
    illnesses, injuries, and hospitalizations).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Every dollar spent on the
    gang situation is a dollar taken away from providing quality schools for all
    children, from street and other infrastructure maintenance and growth, and from
    improving the quality of life we all want so badly to enjoy.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/schools.htm">Schools</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Too many children are dropping out of school. For some students, dropping out is an indicator of school failure.
    School failure is also significantly correlated with delinquency. If the
    association drawn between school failure and poor self-esteem is also true,
    non-attendees face a dour and potentially problematic future.</p>
    <p>Children, teachers, and other school personnel feel the impact of gangs
    directly. They are sometimes afraid to go to the school for fear of being attacked. They also fear damage to their property.
    Gang
    members who attend school are a nuisance and distract teachers and
    students from their primary activity - teaching and learning - ruining the school
    experience for themselves and others.</p>
    <p>Alternative schools, while potentially of value for students who need more supervision,
    isolate problematic youth and are not the answer to the problem. The answer lies
    in responsible parenting, the offering of quality curricula by excellent
    teachers in adequate facilities, and acceptance on the part of the community
    of all people so they may find gainful employment and build a future
    for themselves upon graduation from school.</p>
    <p>Schools are under far too much pressure to provide services which should
    be provided by the students' parents and the community
    at-large. Anger management and conflict resolution programs, substance
    abuse education, and violence reduction programs should not have to be
    offered in our schools. They are symbolic of a collapse in civility in
    the neighborhoods in which they must be offered.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/faith_community.htm">The
    Faith Community</a></font></b></p>
    <p>Based on only a few observations and interviews, the faith community seems to maintain a certain distance from at-risk
    youth. It's emphasis on keeping good kids good is laudable and necessary.
    A
    lack of cooperation and collaboration among the various faiths, however,
    limits faith institutions and faith leaders from becoming a more significant
    force in changing peoples'
    lives - particularly the lives of at-risk youth and their parents.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/business_community.htm">The
    Business Community</a></font></b></p>
    <p> I found little support for at-risk- and gang youth in the business
    sector of the communities in which research was conducted. Given the
    importance of the business sector, this is problematic.</p>
    <p>Why would a business want to hire an at-risk, undereducated youth? I can't think of a reason.
    I can think of reasons why the business
    sector would want to improve vocational training at local schools,
    however. I can think of reasons why a local business might want to
    adopt a neighborhood school and help fund such efforts.&nbsp;Every effort
    made in these areas increases the likelihood of creating an educated and
    capable work force in the future and reduces the need for gangs.</p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000"><a href="../what_I_learned_about/media.htm">The
    Mass Media</a></font></b></p>
    <p>The mass media have presented an oversimplified and confusing picture of
    gangs to the public. Misled and frightened, the public has
    identified the
    problem incorrectly (believing the problem is the gangs themselves) and
    supports social policies which do not reduce the <i>real </i>problems -
    those which cause gangs to form in the first place (i.e., racism, poverty,
    unemployment, poor schooling, truancy, substance abuse, child abuse).</p>
    <p>Other than the occasional documentary on gangs, media depictions of the
    gang situation almost routinely fail to identify and explore the <a href="../what_I_learned_about/GANGS/WHYFORM/why_gangs_form.htm#top"> root
    causes of gang formation</a> and gang joining - race and ethnic discrimination
    and its relationship to violence, substance abuse, alienation, and school
    failure.</p>
    <p>The media could be a more pro-social force in our society - promoting
    positive values and contributing to efforts to prevent the formation of
    gangs.</p>
