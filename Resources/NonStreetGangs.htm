		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This article is based on 
		participant observation and interviews<sup> </sup>with outlaw bikers and 
		their female associates over the course<sup> </sup>of 17 years. It 
		describes the place of women in motorcycle gangs<sup> </sup>and the 
		motivations and backgrounds of women affiliated with<sup> </sup>outlaw 
		biker clubs. Biker women are compared to street gang<sup> </sup>girls in 
		terms of their gang participation and relationships<sup> </sup>with male 
		gang members. Over the course of the study, the role<sup> </sup>of women 
		in motorcycle gangs changed. Although earlier biker<sup> </sup>women 
		were simply partners in parties and hedonistic sexuality,<sup> </sup>in 
		modern outlaw gangs, women are expected to be engaged in<sup> </sup>
		economic pursuits for their individual men and sometimes for<sup> </sup>
		the entire club. The changing role of biker women appears to<sup> </sup>
		be influenced by the gangs' increased involvement in crime and<sup>
		</sup>other money-making activities.</p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><font size="2">In May of 2011 
	I received the following email in which the sender objected to the above 
	portrayal of women in motorcycle gangs. She wrote:|</font><br>
	<br>
	&quot;<font size="2">Dr. Carlie, <br>
	<br>
	With all due respect, as I am neither as old, experienced, nor as learned as 
	you, I would like to share my opinion about your article with you as polite 
	and as professionally as I possibly can. <br>
	<br>
	I found the section about the women in MC's to be almost inappropriate and 
	extremely speculative. While you did disclaim that your writings could very 
	well be false, it seems to me that whether or not your were accurate was of 
	no consequence. <br>
	<br>
	Again, this is just my opinion. I see that you must be a professor, and 
	therefore you are probably very busy, but I also feel like the way you wrote 
	this was very haphazard (Carlie was not the author of the review above). I 
	feel like while the &quot;one-percenter&quot; MC's are absolutely usually criminals, 
	they are most definitely not evil men, the way you have portrayed them in 
	this article. As a rational person, I feel like this was much more about 
	showing your distaste of these gangs rather than telling about the facts.
	<br>
	<br>
	I hope my criticism has not offended you-- it certainly was not my 
	intention. I have been doing a small amount of research out of curiosity, 
	and I came across this article by someone who was in an &quot;outlaw motorcycle 
	gang.&quot; It's really very interesting, and it might help some of this article 
	become more accurate: <br>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Most law enforcers and 
		academic experts agree that the largest one-percent motorcycle clubs are 
		a form of organized crime despite their origins as barroom brawlers. A 
		few club goals related to the destruction of rival groups are more or 
		less overtly criminal. Of greater concern to most observers is the 
		manner in which these clubs provide a context for individuals with a 
		high propensity for illegal activity to unite long enough to operate 
		enterprises of varying levels of sophistication. Social isolation from 
		the mainstream intensifies intra-group loyalties as it concentrates 
		members' attention on the underworld. Bikers integrate their private and 
		club lives in a manner that makes the distinction between club-sponsored 
		and other activities problematic. The relationship of these enterprises 
		to the club itself is often murky as is the line between their planned 
		and spontaneous expressive crimes.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This paper outlines the 
		evolution of the Big Four one percent motorcycle clubs: Hell's Angels, 
		Bandidos, Outlaws, and Pagans. From near-groups to well-organized 
		criminal confederations. The insights of criminological theory unify a 
		variety of journalistic and scientific sources into a holistic picture 
		of the development of these organizations. The interaction of members' 
		psychological needs with group dynamics and mainstream social forces 
		lead to periods of expansion as core values shift to emphasize dominance 
		over rivals. The resulting interclub tensions encourage the creation of 
		organized criminal enterprises but also attract police attention. 
		Internecine rivalries were eventually subordinated to these enterprises 
		as their profit potential was recognized and intergroup warfare took its 
		toll. Core biker values were reasserted as certain aspects of club 
		operation became less countercultural in order to assure the future of 
		the subculture and its basic components.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Entry of researchers into 
		a subculture can be fraught with personal and methodological problems 
		resulting in researcher ill health, poor data and corrupt analysis. 
		Based upon the literature a method was developed to avoid these 
		outcomes. The technique was used during a major community psychology 
		intervention requiring a researcher to become deeply immersed into the 
		subculture of Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs (OMCs). We coined the term Insider 
		– Outsider to describe the technique. The technique allowed a complete 
		re-framing of the role of women involved with OMCs. Previous research of 
		women associated with OMCs is scurrilous as the women are defined only 
		by their sexual and economic values to the OMC members. We came to the 
		conclusion that previous research was one of the last bastions of sexist 
		research. Our findings normalized the role of OMC women as, in our 
		methodology, women were actually interviewed, observed and a replicable 
		methodology was used.</p>

		“A Brief History of Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs”</a></b> by William Dulaney.
		<u>International Journal of Motorcycle Studies</u>, November Issue, 
		2005.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Little scholarly research 
		exists which addresses outlaw motorcycle clubs. These works attempt to 
		explore warring factions of outlaw clubs, provide club members’ 
		perspectives about media portrayal, expose myths, and elucidate 
		motorcycle club culture.*1 The literature reveals gaps which leave many 
		unanswered questions: Where do outlaw motorcycle clubs come from? How 
		did they start? How or why did they evolve into alleged international 
		crime organizations? The few histories of outlaw motorcycle 
		organizations date the origins of such clubs to around 1947 and tend to 
		oversimplify the issues of why these clubs formed and who actually 
		joined them. Histories such as these are built on foundations of weak 
		evidence, rendering inconsequential the origins of the subculture and 
		relegating members of early organizations to the marginal status of 
		“malcontents on the edge of society, and other antisocial types who just 
		wanted to raise hell” (Valentine 147). This article extends current 
		research by reaching back nearly half a century before 1947 to link the 
		dawn of motorcycle organizations with the present reality of outlaw 
		motorcycle clubs. The overarching goal of the article is to offer a more 
		comprehensive history, an evolutionary history that may allow for a 
		better understanding of contemporary motorcycle subculture.</p>

		discussed. Their history, number of chapters in the United States and 
		overseas, and a “best guess estimate” of membership numbers are also 
		provided. Similar information is provided on the major independent 1% 
		biker clubs—Warlocks, Mongols and Iron Horsemen. There is also a brief 
		discussion of the role of puppet (support) clubs and the four black or 
		interracial 1% biker clubs. This research, describing the clubs, is the

		“Exporting American Organized Crime--Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs”</a></b> by 
		Tom Barker. <u>Journal of Gang Research</u>, vol.11, no.2 (37-50), 
		winter 2004.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">In the 1940's, the 
		president of the American Motorcycle Association stated that 1 percent 
		of the bikers were the ones damaging the image of all bikers. OMG's have 
		gloried in this recognition and have labeled themselves as 
		&quot;1-percenters.&quot; They thus relish their antisocial, intimidating, and 
		violent criminal image. Based on a review of various sources of 
		information on OMG's, including reports of undercover police officers 
		and the OMGs' own Web sites, this paper profiles the big three OMG's, 
		i.e., Hell's Angels, the Outlaws, and the Bandidos. Although originating 
		in America, these OMG's have established chapters in countries 
		throughout the world, and this has included the exporting of the 
		criminal image and activities of OMG's. The interlocking networks of 
		OMG's on a global scale has allowed American-based OMG's to link common 
		criminal enterprises and the benefits derived from them. In 1991 
		Interpol created Operation Rockers to counter the rapid expansion of 
		OMG's throughout the world. The objectives of this project are to 
		identify motorcycle gangs that are engaged in continuous criminal 
		activities; to identify each gang's membership, hierarchy, modus 
		operandi, and specific criminal activity; to correlate the information 
		for analysis and dissemination; to assist member countries in the 
		exchange of criminal intelligence information; and to identify specific 
		contact officers within Interpol's National Central Bureau who can then 
		link up with law enforcement agencies that have expertise with OMG's. 
		Because of the profits involved in their expanded criminal enterprises, 
		experts expect that OMG expansion efforts will continue.</p>

		“Motorcycle Gangs or Motorcycle Mafia?”</a></b> by S Trethewy and T 
		Katz. <u>Police Chief</u>, vol.65, no.4 (53-60), April 1998.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">With more than 50 years 
		to hone their criminal &quot;skills,&quot; outlaw motorcycle gangs have become a 
		criminal force to be reckoned with. They have organized behind a 
		hierarchical structure with bylaws and meetings. Some gangs are so 
		concerned about their image that they have copyrighted and trademarked 
		their logos and gang names. Members attend functions (runs) together to 
		solidify their unity and brotherhood as a &quot;family.&quot; These gangs do not 
		just work parallel with traditional organized crime groups, they 
		cooperate on joint ventures and compete in other areas. Furthermore, 
		their inter-gang connections with prison gangs, the Ku Klux Klan, other 
		white supremacy groups, street gangs, and drug groups have enhanced 
		their criminal networking, allowing their tentacles to reach all parts 
		of society. It is imperative that interagency joint law enforcement task 
		force operations rethink their efforts to combat this threat, since no 
		one agency has the means to investigate and prosecute outlaw motorcycle 
		gangs successfully. Recent cases by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
		Firearms and the Drug Enforcement Administration have resulted in 
		multiple arrests of Hell's Angels and Hessians. FBI agents have arrested 
		members of the Devil's Disciples and Outlaws. The more successful cases 
		involved the experience and expertise of local and State police who 
		joined with the Federal agents.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This study examines

		Group interviews with female motorcyclists explore the meaning of this

		empowerment that women gain by participating in motorcycling. This study 
		demonstrates the role facilitators play in creating and cultivating 
		sources of empowerment. It also exposes how feelings of guilt, 
		vulnerability, and concern about societal images can undermine women's 
		feelings of empowerment. “Girl power” represents women's attempts to 
		redefine femininity in a way that embraces the positive aspects of both 
		femininity and masculinity and resists negative stereotypes that

		“Truth About Outlaw Bikers &amp; What You Can Expect If They Come to Your 
		Town”</a></b> by Andrew M. Grascia. <u>Journal of Gang Research</u>, 
		vol.11, no.4 (1-15), summer 2004.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">In the late 1940's, 
		bikers vandalized the town of Hollister, CA when a member of the biker 
		group called the Pissed Off Bastards of Bloomington was arrested for 
		fighting. From this time, approximately 1 percent of biker groups have 
		prided themselves on being &quot;outlaws&quot; who flaunt the laws and values of 
		society. Currently, it is estimated that there are between 300 to 900 
		outlaw biker gangs in America, with some gangs having more than 1 
		chapter. There are four outlaw biker gangs -- Hells Angels, Outlaws, 
		Pagans, and Bandidos -- that control most of the biker world. Although 
		biker gangs may be based in a particular area, they travel freely in a 
		format called &quot;biker runs.&quot; The bikers travel as a group on trips that 
		are highly organized and planned, with numerous security precautions. 
		Narcotics distribution is believed to be the biggest money-maker for the 
		Big Four biker gangs. Intelligence collection is important in 
		determining the crime patterns and vulnerabilities of biker gangs. 
		Undercover work that involves attending some of their regular meetings 
		and participating in biker runs is the best way to collect intelligence 
		information. This article also describes police interviewing techniques 
		with biker gang members. This article concludes that biker gangs are the 
		new organized crime group of the world. They are highly sophisticated 
		and have millions of dollars to counter law enforcement and prosecution 
		efforts. The Big Four have no restraints when it comes to achieving 
		their criminal goals. In 2002 alone there were at least 61 incidents of 
		extreme violence that involved the Big Four in the United States and 
		Canada.</p>

		“Bonds of Brotherhood: The Origin and Growth of Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs”</a></b> 
		by Heather Hamilton. <u>Gazette</u>, vol.64, no.3 (4-5), 2002.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMGs) 
		first appeared in the United States in the late 1940's as returning 
		soldiers with few job opportunities formed motorcycle clubs to regain 
		bonds of brotherhood. The first Hells Angels chapter emerged in 1948. In 
		the 1980's the Hells Angels required that new club chapters have 
		permanent members with expertise in profitable criminal activities. 
		Currently, the Hells Angels have 217 chapters in 27 countries with 
		approximately 3,000 members, and they continue to expand. In Canada, 
		OMGs first appeared in Ontario and Quebec in the early 1950's. 
		Throughout the 1980's and 1990's, the Hells Angels continually expanded 
		their chapters and membership. Currently, there are 26 OMGs in the 
		country, with the Hells Angels being the most powerful and tightly 
		structured. Across the country, OMGs, particularly the Hells Angles, are 
		involved in money laundering, intimidation, assaults, attempted murder, 
		murder, fraud, theft, counterfeiting, loan-sharking, extortion, 
		prostitution, escort agencies, strip clubs, the possession and 
		trafficking of illegal weapons, stolen goods, contraband, and illicit 
		alcohol and cigarettes. A chapter operates in a given city or region and 
		maintains independence over internal discipline and criminal activities 
		of the chapter in its region. Wearing colors that bear the insignia of 
		the gang is the culmination of the biker's training period. A fortified 
		clubhouse equipped with a sophisticated security system serves as a 
		chapter's meeting place. Patches and tattoos show members' status within 
		the organization.</p>

		2006. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">In contrast to recent 
		popular portrayals of outlaw motorcycle gangs as groups of harmless, 
		misunderstood outcasts, the author contends that outlaw motorcycle gang 
		members are dangerous criminals who are heavily involved in the 
		international drug trade, particularly methamphetamine. Previous 
		research on the criminal activities of outlaw motorcycle gangs, 
		particularly Hells Angeles, is presented as evidence of the author’s 
		argument. Research from the National Drug Intelligence Center from 2002 
		and 2003 illustrates the increasing methamphetamine problem in Maryland, 
		Pennsylvania, and Virginia, which identifies outlaw motorcycle gangs as 
		the principal dealers and traffickers of the drug in all three States. 
		The author describes how outlaw motorcycle gangs gain power in prisons 
		through criminal “business” contacts and how they hold their power by 
		exploiting criminal street gangs like the “Bloods” and Crips,” who are 
		used to shield the outlaw motorcycle gangs from law enforcement. Their 
		tactics for creating legitimacy in society are examined and range from 
		establishing legitimate businesses to gaining education and making 
		generous charitable donations. The public is urged to see outlaw 
		motorcycle gangs for what they are and to break the mystic and 
		acceptance these groups have managed to gain.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The results indicated 
		that SNA can be effectively used to aid law enforcement investigations 
		of organized criminal groups. SNA should be used to enhance 
		intelligence-led policing, not replace it, and can be effective when the 
		goal is to disrupt or dismantle a criminal group. In the current case, 
		the social network analysis of an OMG in Canada revealed that key 
		figures in a criminal organization may not be those who hold formal 
		leadership roles. Data were collected from Canadian intelligence 
		agencies responsible for intelligence data on organized crime groups. 
		Due to the sensitive nature of the data, all dates were omitted by the 
		intelligence agencies. Data provided information on three OMG networks 
		chosen for their close proximity and similarity of function. Smallest 
		Space Analysis (SSA) was employed to develop a matrix illustrating the 
		associations between the members of the network. Calculations of 
		centrality, closeness, and network cliques are presented and key 
		communication channels flowing through the networks are examined. The 
		authors note that the amount of information able to be included in a 
		social network analysis is limited only by the information collection

		“Finding a Formula That Fits: Partnerships Spell Success in the Fight

		vol.64, no.3 (7-9), 2002.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Operation Springtime 2001 
		provided the first blueprint for partnerships in effective operations 
		against outlaw biker gangs. When the one-day police operation was 
		completed in March 2001, police at the national, provincial, and 
		municipal levels had arrested 138 bikers and their associates during 
		simultaneous raids throughout Quebec and other parts of Canada. This 
		project became the model for other investigations. Successes against the 
		biker gangs have been attributed largely to better coordination and 
		cooperation among police forces and better availability of tools such as 
		new legislation, funding, and personnel to conduct long-term 
		investigations. This article describes recent operations that have 
		succeeded in weakening the criminal impact of outlaw biker gangs across 
		Canada. In Alberta, Operation Shadow involved 200 police from the 
		Calgary Police Service, Edmonton Police Service, the Royal Canadian 
		Mounted Police in Alberta and Kelowna (British Columbia), as well as 
		Criminal intelligence Service Alberta. Police agencies in Saskatchewan 
		and Manitoba were also involved in task force operations. The operation 
		targeted the Hells Angels in Alberta. Similar task force operations were 
		conducted in other jurisdictions. Through interagency cooperation in 
		jurisdictional task forces supplied with sufficient resources and 
		personnel, investigations and coordinated arrests have seriously 
		disrupted the criminal activities of outlaw motorcycle gangs.</p>

		“Skinheads: Manifestations of the Warrior Culture of the New Urban 
		Tribes”</a></b> by Gregg W. Etter Sr. <u>Journal of Gang Research</u>, 
		vol.6, no.3 (9-21) spring 1999.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Skinheads take their name 
		from their military basic- training-style haircuts. They view themselves 
		as the divinely chosen protectors of their race and nation. They believe 
		they will be called on to defend both the white race and the nation in a 
		race war that they believe is forthcoming. Among the urban street gangs 
		that compose the new urban tribes, the skinheads are the most vocal in 
		their adoption of the warrior culture. Skinheads believe the white man 
		built America and that the Jews and minorities are undermining and 
		corrupting what whites have built. The warrior culture in the United 
		States and to a lesser extent in Great Britain has been changed by 
		political and social events into a pseudo-paramilitary type culture that 
		many of the white youth participate in through games, movies, books, 
		etc. Given the many social, cultural, and economic changes that have 
		impacted American male youths' development of self-esteem through 
		gender, economic, and social roles, many youth who have failed to 
		develop a satisfactory identity within the context of these changes have 
		opted to become part of a warrior culture. They fantasize about the 
		powers and features of a paramilitary warrior who fights to preserve 
		what he perceives to be the status, achievements, and dominance of his 
		tribe. After reviewing the history of skinheads from the British Union 
		of Fascists (1923-39) through the American skinheads from the late 
		1970's to the present, this article discusses skinhead music; religion; 
		totemism, graffiti, and tattoos; skinhead crimes; and the transmission

		“Sounds of Hate: White Power Rock and Roll and the Neo-Nazi Skinhead

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This article deals with 
		the most violent sub-group of a variety of contemporary right-wing 
		extremist organizations - neo-Nazi skinheads. Specifically, I argue that 
		in order to understand the growth and violent nature of this subculture 
		it is necessary to address the important role played by its main 
		propaganda tool called white power rock and roll. After reviewing the 
		close relationship between this music and the historical development of 
		the present day international neo-Nazi skinhead network, I examine the 
		main themes found within white power rock and roll by placing them 
		within the context of contemporary right-wing extremist ideology and 
		noting differences where appropriate. In general, this propaganda seeks 
		to incite violent activity by accentuating perceived threats from a 
		conspiracy of enemies and by constructing a 'warrior' subculture that 
		glorifies aggression and sacrifice. Contrary to some predictions, 
		skinheads will continue to present a significant problem in terms of 
		hate crime due to the steady proliferation of producers of this

		(25-31), winter 2003.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Web sites where persons 
		can order hate music on the Internet abound. The author of this article 
		ordered five CDs of five different groups from some of these Web sites. 
		Many of the CDs predict and advocate a race war and encourage White 
		youth to prepare for it by obtaining weapons. Hate music can be broken 
		down into several categories that include White Power Rock, National 
		Socialist Black Metal, Fascist Experimental, and Racist Country. In 
		message and terminology, hate music promotes the causes of white 
		supremacist groups. This is evident even in the titles of the CDs, which 
		include the following: &quot;Land of the Whites,&quot; &quot;Brown Town Burning Down,&quot; 
		&quot;Gays Gotta Go,&quot; &quot;Black Plague Terror,&quot; and &quot;Get Out of My Land.&quot; 
		Apparently there are no statistics kept on how many hate-music CDs have 
		been sold worldwide; however, Interpol (International Police 
		Organization) estimated that during 1999 the European neo-Nazi music 
		industry was worth $3.4 million a year. When Resistance Records was 
		raided in 1997-98, some 200,000 tapes and CDs worth $3 million were 
		confiscated. Record labels that produce hate music are not mainstream, 
		and in some cases they have changed their names several times to add to 
		the confusion about how widespread this music has become. The 
		availability and accessibility of this music should be of concern to 
		parents whose children may be exposed to hate music. In many cases, the 
		Web sites that market this music contain spoken hate messages designed

		“Skinheads: A Three Nation Comparison”</a></b> by Wendy L. Hicks. <u>
		Journal of Gang Research</u>, vol.11, no.2 (51-73), winter 2004.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Research has found that 
		the Skinhead Nation is highly organized, shares common political 
		viewpoints, and works in concert with other right-wing hate groups such 
		as the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nation, and the neo-Nazi Party on an 
		international scale. The earliest &quot;skinheads&quot; in Great Britain were 
		working-class youths from the poorer strata of society, who were 
		concentrated in the East End of London. The skinhead appearance 
		consisted of short hair, work jeans, or stay-pressed trousers, plain 
		button-down Ben Sherman or Fred Perry shirts, black felt &quot;donkey 
		jackets,&quot; &quot;Blue Beat&quot; hats, and high dockworker boots. The violence of 
		the skinheads reflected the ideals of super masculinity and machismo. 
		The primary target for skinhead violence in England was the Pakistanis, 
		who were sharply differentiated in British society by racial 
		characteristics, religious rituals, food taboos, and a value system that 
		encouraged deference, frugality, and the profit motive. In America the 
		skinheads are basically a youth movement. Joining the skinheads is the 
		first step in recruitment of a young person interested in becoming 
		involved in the white supremacy movement. Unlike Britain and Europe, 
		American skinheads are a &quot;suburban and small-town phenomenon&quot; (Ridgeway, 
		1990). American skinheads are also more violent when confronted by 
		minorities than are their European counterparts. In America the single 
		most stated reason for joining the Skinhead Nation is to fight for the 
		survival of the White race. Skinhead violence in America was once random 
		and impulsive, but recently the violence has become more organized and 
		planned. In examining the socioeconomic conditions that tend to increase 
		the motivation among youth to join the skinheads, this paper considers 
		the economic situations of both France and Great Britain, two countries 
		with significantly different situations regarding white supremacist 
		organizations. It notes that one of the primary factors in the creation 
		of a hostile climate toward ethnic-minority groups is the political 
		reaction of the government to newly arrived immigrants and how those 
		governmental policies are interpreted by the native citizenry. The 
		economic analysis of Britain and France concludes that the underlying 
		mechanisms of skinhead recruitment fail when the feelings of abandonment 
		by the governmental system are absent. In France there is an 
		institutionalized front that maintains the subservience of immigrants, 
		such that French workers need not be worried about being replaced by an 
		immigrant worker. In Britain and the United States the situation is 
		reversed. Working-class people fear the possibility that their job will 
		be taken by a foreigner or a Black, further eroding their quality of 
		life and socioeconomic status. Such a climate provides ample opportunity 
		and motivation for racist hate groups to thrive.</p>

		correctional institution. Membership has grown out of necessity and 
		popularity, absorbing other white gangs, generically called Peckerwoods, 
		into the ranks. There are now NLR members in custody in the Federal 
		system who have been implicated in at least one murder in a Federal 
		institution in 1997. As NLR members parole into California communities, 
		criminal gang activity flourishes exponentially among whites as never 
		before. A driving force behind the NLR is the manufacture, sale, and use 
		of methamphetamine. Connections have been found between the NLR and 
		outlaw motorcycle gangs such as the Hells Angels. These associations and 
		investigations have led many in law enforcement to conclude that the NLR 
		is the new enforcement arm of the Aryan Brotherhood. Some lessons have 
		been learned through the profiling of white supremacy gangs. First, 
		these gangs are contenders among street and prison gangs, and members 
		should be treated with vigor and aggressiveness by law enforcement. 
		Second, no one single agency can monitor and combat the NLR; multiagency 
		cooperation and support are required. Also, females are entrenched in 
		criminal gang activity and should not be overlooked in investigations.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The NLR was founded in 
		the late 1970's by John Stinson, a White supremacist, while he was an 
		inmate in a California Youth Authority prison. A small number of Latinos 
		were allowed to join, and they were put on the front lines in the gang's 
		drug trafficking both inside and outside prison. In recent years, the 
		NLR has spread from the California Youth Authority into the adult 
		prisons of California and several other States. All members must be 
		loyal to the White race and subscribe to an ideology of hate, especially 
		against Blacks and &quot;race traitors.&quot; Although experts report that most 
		NLR crimes outside of prison are related to the drug trade, NLR members 
		have been involved in some of the most disturbing hate crimes in 
		California, including the kidnapping and murder of a bisexual man, a 
		near-fatal hammer attack on an African-American, and a baseball-bat 
		attack on a Black youth. In recent years, the NLR has faced the same 
		countermeasures as the declining Aryan Brotherhood; the NLR has been 
		declared a prison gang, which warrants the segregation of gang members 
		while they are in prison. This strategy, along with the 2003 convictions 
		of several NLR leaders, has led the NLR to make alliances with a 
		smaller, less well-known group, namely, Public Enemy Number One (PENI). 
		PENI and the NLR have worked with the Aryan Brotherhood in various 
		combinations in the drug trade.</p>

		Magazine</u>, vol.23, no.3 (46-48), March 1999. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The origin of the NLR can 
		be traced to inmates held by the California Youth Authority (State 
		prison for juveniles in California). As the white-supremacist Aryan 
		Brotherhood was targeted for suppression in correctional facilities by 
		the Department of Corrections, the NLR emerged as allies or soldiers to 
		continue the in-prison illegal activities of the Aryan Brotherhood. 
		Considered both a prison and a street gang, the NLR has developed a 
		reputation for being cold-blooded and ruthless. NLR members have been 
		linked to murders, home-invasion robberies, witness intimidation, drug 
		sales, and assaults on police officers. NLR female associates and gang 
		members can be just as ruthless and violent as their male counterparts. 
		They run interference for the male members in their operations. Around 
		1995, law enforcement officers recognized the NLR as a gang growing in 
		numbers and gaining strength through the lucrative methamphetamine 
		trade. In California alone there are more than 1,000 NLR members. The 
		NLR, with its white-supremacist philosophy, has recruited from the ranks 
		of the skinheads. Some skinhead gangs have also aligned themselves with 
		the NLR. This type of alignment might facilitate the building of a 
		national reputation for NLR.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Over the last decade

		recommendations on how to combat the problem are presented. Survey 
		questionnaires were distributed to any and all adult correctional 
		facilities known to exist in the 50 States during the first 6 months of 
		2004. Respondents returned 193 surveys from 49 States. Most questions 
		used in the survey were previously used in surveys by the National Gang 
		Crime Research Center (NGCRC). New survey items focused on White racist 
		extremists and their religious practices in prison. The majority of 
		respondents believed that tougher laws were needed to control the prison 
		gang problem; that prison is a recruitment ground for new gang members; 
		and that Federal agencies should play a greater role in prosecuting gang 
		crimes. Survey data allowed the generation of the “Top Ten American 
		Prison Gangs” which include the Aryan Brotherhood, Aryan Nation, 
		Skinheads, and the Ku Klux Klan. The survey also revealed that an 
		astonishing 53.2 percent of prison officials did not know what the 
		“Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act” (RLUIPA) is; 
		RLUIPA extended new religious rights to inmates, some of whom quickly 
		used these rights to organize gang activity. Activities controlled by 
		gangs in State prisons included drugs (87.8 percent), protection (76.2 
		percent), gambling (73.2 percent), and extortion (70.1 percent). Factors 
		differentiating gang riots, race riots, and religious riots are 
		considered. Respondents identified segregated housing and intelligence 
		gathering as among the most innovative solutions for combating the gang

		Study of Religion</u>, vol.40, no.2 (287-302), June 2001. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This paper applies the 
		concept of identity to the white racialist or separatist movement, 
		typically referred to as the white supremacist movement in many 
		mainstream publications. While similar racial identity and shared 
		perceptions of the meaning of racialism bind the movement together, 
		there are other important concerns that potentially divide the movement 
		but also have served to attract members to it. One of these potentially 
		divisive areas, the differences in religious views, is explored here 
		through an analysis of the white separatist literature and interviews 
		with movement members. Three belief systems of movement 
		members—Christian or Israel Identity, Church of the Creator, and Odinism—are 
		examined. All three contribute to strengthening the racial identity of 
		white racialists, but are at the same time potentially antagonistic to

		under the influence of several dynamics, and has become particularly 
		threatening to the state and society in the last ten to twenty years 
		with the cocaine boom. The historic ability of the Mexican political 
		system to manage corruption has diminished if not collapsed as cartels 
		have largely moved from a relationship of symbiosis with and 
		subordination to the authorities to one of dominance and intimidation of 
		them. The US has facilitated this process in several unfortunate ways 
		beyond enormous drug demand. Recent developments, including amore 
		constructive relationship between the US and Mexico following the 
		elections of Fox and then Bush, offer some hope that the future of

		“Organised Crime in South Africa: An Assessment of Its Nature and 
		Origins”</a></b> by Peter Gastrow. <u>Institute for Security Studies, 
		South Africa</u>, (1-75) Aug 1998. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Information for the study 
		came from police sources and official documents. The analysis revealed 
		that notorious and often colorful gangs and criminal groups have been 
		present in South Africa throughout its recorded history. Street gangs 
		and the more sophisticated criminal syndicates had developed many common 
		characteristics by 1980. The focus of police investigations in the 1980s 
		was more on individuals than on the criminal conspiracies or the 
		networks behind the organized criminal conduct. In addition, the 
		protection of the political status quo was a higher priority for the 
		government than was crime prevention. The profits from drug trafficking 
		and the police focus on national security rather than crime control were 
		central to the rapid expansion of organized crime in the 1980s. However, 
		the police restructuring of 1990-91 led to a focus on the planners and 
		organizers of crime. The release of Nelson Mandela and the end to the 
		ban on political organizations accelerated the transition process of the 
		police. The six case studies illustrate different composition, 
		structure, method of operating, and stage of development of criminal 
		syndicates. South Africa now needs to ensure that it takes steps through 
		policy, legislation, and resources to link up with the international 
		efforts against organized crime, as exemplified by the treaty-drafting 
		efforts of the United Nations and the European Union on this topic.</p>

		“The Economics of Organized Crime and Optimal Law Enforcement”</a></b>

		2000.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This article extends the 
		optimal law enforcement literature to organized crime. I model the 
		criminal organization as a vertical structure where the principal 
		extracts some rents from the agents through extortion. As long as 
		extortion is a costless transfer from individuals to the criminal 
		organization, not only the existence of extortion is social welfare 
		improving because it makes engaging in a criminal offense less 
		attractive but it also allows the government to reduce expenditures on 
		law enforcement. When extortion is costly because the criminal 
		organization resorts to threats and violence, the existence of extortion 
		is social welfare diminishing and may lead to higher expenditures on law 
		enforcement.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The paper argues that the

		notions: a) the provision of illegal goods and services and b) a 
		criminal organization, understood as a large-scale collectivity, 
		primarily engaged in illegal activities with a well-defined collective 
		identity and subdivision of work among its members. Against this 
		superimposition, the author's contention is twofold: (1) The supply of 
		illegal commodities mainly takes place in a `disorganized' way and, due 
		to the constraints of product illegality, no immanent tendency towards 
		the development of large-scale criminal enterprises within illegal 
		markets exist. (2) Some lasting large-scale criminal organizations do 
		exist, but they are neither exclusively involved in illegal market 
		activities, nor is their development and internal configuration the

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This article applies the

		that it emphasizes a common supposition held by each paradigm – that 
		human relationships form the basis for organized criminal activity. By 
		understanding the dynamics behind these relationships and the networks

		of Criminology</u>, vol.42, no.1, (39-60), Jan 2000.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The research focused on 
		three main groups: criminal business organizations, street gangs, and &quot;wanna-be&quot; 
		groups. Criminal business organizations are organized groups that 
		exhibit a formal structure and a high degree of sophistication; they are 
		comprised primarily of adults. Street gangs are groups of youth who band 
		together to form a semi structured organization that engages in planned 
		and profitable criminal behavior or organized violence against rival 
		street gangs. &quot;Wanna-be&quot; groups are clusters of youth who band together 
		in a loosely structured group to engage in spontaneous social activity 
		and exciting, impulsive criminal activity, including collective violence 
		against other groups of youth. The research subjects were all adults and 
		youth on the caseloads of corrections personnel in the Greater Vancouver 
		area in January 1995, as well as those who were added to their caseloads 
		during the following 6 months and were identified by these personnel as 
		being involved with gangs. The research involved reviewing and 
		extracting information from client files, interviews with clients who 
		were willing to participate (33 of the 128 subjects agreed to be 
		interviewed), and discussions of individual cases with probation 
		officers and police officers. The research found that the reasons why 
		individuals become involved with these organizations, gangs, and groups 
		are economic and ethnic marginality, material gain, the attraction of 
		supportive peer groups, and escape from abusive family circumstances. To 
		be effective, policy and program responses must recognize the 
		differences among organizations, gangs, and groups, as well as the 
		various factors that underlie initial and continued membership</p>

		structures across national boundaries. However accurate such a view may 
		or may not have been in the United States, where it originated, evidence 
		from a Dutch survey of organized crime enterprises reveals a different 
		picture. For organized crime in northwestern Europe, it is more helpful 
		to think of crime markets of two kinds: those in which the goods and 
		services are themselves forbidden, and those in which legal goods and 
		services are handled in illegal ways. Case studies of the drug trade, 
		and of organized crime in the business realm, offer a detailed look at 
		these two kinds of markets. The evidence suggests that while organized 
		crime enterprises conduct trade across national boundaries, they do not 
		constitute an international authority structure. Crime entrepreneurs 
		constitute a challenge, not to the basic structure of society itself, 
		but rather a more subtle kind of challenge to basic values and morals, 
		particularly when criminal enterprise is linked to power at higher

		“Chinese Transnational Organized Crime: The Fuk Ching”</a></b> by James 
		O Finckenauer. <u>United Nations Activities</u>, May 2007.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The Fuk Ching emerged in 
		New York City in the mid-1980s, founded by a group of young Chinese from 
		China's Fujian Province. Many, if not all, of the founders had criminal 
		records in China. Fuk Ching recruitment continues among Fujianese teens. 
		Currently, the Fuk Ching is estimated to have approximately 35 members, 
		with another 20 members in prison. Experts agree that the Fuk Ching, 
		like other Chinese gangs, do not have the connections and sophistication 
		necessary to corrupt U.S. police and judges. Although Fuk Ching has some 
		ability to manipulate the political system through corruption in Fujian 
		Province with respect to their human trafficking, there is no evidence 
		that Fuk Ching has corrupted the political process in the United States. 
		Police strategies for countering Fuk Ching include informants, 
		undercover investigators, and electronic surveillance. Both the New York 
		City police and the FBI encourage extortion victims to use hot lines to 
		report their victimization. The Fuk Ching mainly operates extortion and 
		protection rackets in defined neighborhoods in New York's Chinatown, 
		with victims being mostly businesses. Its transnational criminal 
		activities consist of the smuggling of migrants across national borders 
		and human trafficking that includes coercion (kidnapping) and 
		exploitation in the destination country. Fujian Province is the primary 
		source area for Chinese smuggled and trafficked into the United States. 
		Fuk Ching members are violent, but their violence is not strategically 
		targeted toward the protection and expansion of their criminal 
		enterprises. Members tend to engage in random street violence with guns.</p>

		vol.15, no.1 (25-45), Jan 1995.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This paper develops a 
		transaction cost-based theory of organized crime. Following Schelling (<i>Journal 
		of Public Law</i> 1967; 20:71–84), I treat the organized criminal firm 
		as a formal governance structure that specializes in providing illegal 
		goods and services to downstream buyers. Drawing upon Williamsonian 
		transaction cost analysis and the literature on self-enforcing 
		contracts, the paper predicts which illegal goods and services will be 
		supplied in the marketplace by organized criminal firms versus 
		internally by downstream firms. The paper highlights the joint roles of 
		production scale economies, contracting frequency, transaction 
		specificity, and uncertainty to predict the activities of organized 
		crime. These four factors appear capable of explaining many of the 
		important empirical regularities in markets where organized crime is 
		present.</p>

		and non-gang homicides were found. These differences centered primarily 
		on guns and the similarity of victim and offender characteristics. Gang

		<p style="margin-left: .5in">The emergence of criminal secret societies 
		in post-Mao China has closely correlated with the criminal subcultures, 
		massive unemployment, impoverishment, economic inequality, relative 
		deprivation, and political corruption that have arisen from the reform 
		process. Although perceived as the roots of organized crime worldwide, 
		these variables have generated crime incentives—mainly among

		in most of Western societies. The factors underlying organized crime in 
		China are not simply the by-products of economic liberalization, but 
		rather related to the structural problems caused by flawed reform 
		policies and China's particular political context. These problems 
		account to a large extent for the double nature of many criminal 
		organizations as both anti-social and anti-state forces. The regime's 
		crackdown on organized crime may hamper efforts for greater

		emphasis on the implications of these phenomena for the United States 
		Armed Forces. This review includes an in-depth discussion of three main 
		approaches to understanding right-wing extremism, and an examination of 
		actual cases of extremist activity in the military. Next, the review 
		considers documented and potential cases of gang activity in the 
		military. Throughout this review, opportunities for identifying and 
		screening gang members and extremists are highlighted, as are some 
		drawbacks and caveats regarding such screening. The second major section 
		of the report reviews the military's current responses to the problems 
		of gangs and extremism among enlisted personnel. It begins by discussing 
		the enlistment process, including prescreening by recruiters, aptitude 
		and medical screening at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPSs), 
		background screening during the pre-enlistment and pre-accession phases 
		of the enlistment process, and further enlistee observation occurring at 
		Recruit Training Centers (RTCs). Next, a variety of Department of 
		Defense (DoD) Directives and Service policies regarding active-duty 
		personnel are discussed. Here, particular attention is given to how such 
		policies have been changing in response to the rise of problems like 
		gang and extremist activity among military personnel and to how the 
		different Services have approached such problems. Finally, the 
		military's current efforts to research gang and extremist problems

		(110-123), Feb 2003.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The media representations 
		of the terrorist attacks of September 11 in the United States and their 
		aftermath bear strong similarities to the media coverage of 'Lebanese 
		youth gangs' over the last few years - both rely significantly on the 
		metaphor of war. This paper explores two media narratives about Lebanese 
		youth gangs which draw on this metaphor - the first deploys a simple 
		us/them structure which, like the dominant Western reportage of the 
		terrorist crisis, turns on a form of moral reduction in which the forces 
		of good and evil are relatively clear. The accumulated imagery of 
		Lebanese gangs, drugs, crime, violence and 'ethnic gang rape' 
		articulates a dangerous otherness of those of Arabic-speaking background 
		- echoed in the coverage of the terrorist 'attack on America'. This 
		simple narrative, however, gives way to a second, emerging narrative 
		about Lebanese youth gangs which also relies on the metaphor of war but 
		acknowledges the moral duplicity of both 'combatants' - registering the 
		culpability of the state and its police service but distancing 'the 
		ordinary Australian' from this culpability. The second narrative, like 
		the first, tries to recuperate a moral innocence for the 'ordinary 
		Australian', but in doing so underlines a crisis in Australian 
		multiculturalism.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Research has documented

		how gang involvement shapes young women's risks of victimization. Based 
		on interviews with active gang members, the author suggests that (1) 
		gang participation exposes youths to victimization risk and (2) it does 
		so in gendered ways. Young women can use gender to decrease their risk 
		of being harmed by rival gangs or other street participants by not 
		participating in &quot;masculine&quot; activities such as fighting and committing 
		crime. However, the consequence is that they are viewed as lesser 
		members of their gangs and may be exposed to greater risk of 
		victimization within their gangs. The author suggests that more research 
		is needed to examine whether and how gang involvement enhances youths'

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Prison gangs share

		prison quality of life have motivated correctional responses to crime, 
		disorder, and rule violations, and many correctional agencies have 
		developed policies to control prison gang-affiliated inmates. The 
		authors review the history of and correctional mechanisms to cope with 
		prison gangs. A gang suppression strategy based on segregation,

		is to inform law enforcement personnel, including prison guards, about 
		the types of behaviors and activities that career criminals, prison 
		gangs, and Security Threat Groups (STGs) engage in so as to reduce the 
		threat posed by these three groups. The authors contend that experience 
		is the best teacher when it comes to understanding career criminals, and 
		in an effort to assist other law enforcement officers, the authors note 
		several characteristics of these types of criminals. Next, the authors 
		discuss STGs, which are defined by Federal prison officials as an 
		identifiable collection of inmates who pose a hazard to the penal 
		system. These STGs may form prison gangs that are potentially more 
		powerful than street gangs. Prison gangs recruit members and associates 
		from within the prison and also recruit street gangs to carry out 
		assignments. Finally, the authors discuss the ways in which criminal 
		justice professionals should assess and deal with STGs and prison gangs. 
		Generally, the approach is to assess group behavior rather than focusing 
		on individual members. Criminal justice professionals must always be on 
		guard because prison gang members constantly scrutinize guards and 
		officers for any signs of weakness. In conclusion, the authors assert 
		that a focus on the activities of career criminals, prison gangs, and

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">A study of 792 inmates at

		gang formation is fostered at juvenile detention camps through a 
		juvenilization process that culminates in subsequent adult 
		incarceration. In North Carolina prisons, offenders who have previously 
		been confined at a State juvenile center are more likely to band 
		together with others who have shared similar juvenile center 
		experiences. This association transcends race, religion, family and

		the nature of social organization inside the prison. The article 
		describes recent gang control and &quot;social organization enhancement&quot;

		application in prison facilities statewide. Altering the physical

		broken windows theory as adapted for the prison setting. Non-gang 
		inmates feel more secure and perhaps behave accordingly and prison gang

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">To explain the astounding

		management of dispossessed and<sup> </sup>dishonored groups. This 
		article places the prison in the <i>historical<sup> </sup>sequence of 
		`peculiar institutions'</i> that have shouldered the<sup> </sup>task of 
		defining and confining African Americans, alongside<sup> </sup>slavery, 
		the Jim Crow regime, and the ghetto. The recent upsurge<sup> </sup>in 
		black incarceration results from the crisis of the ghetto<sup> </sup>as 
		device for caste control and the correlative need for a substitute<sup>

		</sup>In the post-Civil Rights era, the vestiges of the dark ghetto<sup>
		</sup>and the expanding prison system have become linked by a triple<sup>
		</sup>relationship of functional equivalency, structural homology,<sup>
		</sup>and cultural fusion, spawning a carceral continuum that entraps<sup>
		</sup>a population of younger black men rejected by the deregulated<sup>
		</sup>wage-labor market. This carceral mesh has been solidified by<sup>
		</sup>changes that have reshaped the urban `Black Belt' of mid-century<sup>
		</sup>so as to <i>make the ghetto more like a prison</i> and undermined 
		the<sup> </sup>`inmate society' residing in U.S. penitentiaries in ways 
		that<sup> </sup><i>make the prison more like a ghetto.</i> The resulting

		“From the Street to the Prison: Understanding and Responding to Gangs”</a></b> 
		by Scott H Decker. <u>National Major Gang Task Force, United States</u>, 
		(1-86), 9 Feb 2001.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The discussion emphasized 
		gang processes, especially as those processes offered opportunities for 
		intervention and prevention. These processes included joining the gang, 
		initiation, assuming roles within the gang, participating in gang 
		violence, and leaving the gang. The analysis noted that the last decade 
		had produced an unprecedented increase in gangs, gun assaults, and youth 
		homicide. These increases have resulted in actions by Federal and local 
		governments. Suppression has been the most common strategy. However, 
		this response is unlikely to be effective on its own and is likely to 
		make the problem worse. Federal initiatives that emphasize suppression 
		or the provision of social opportunities have taken place in the last 
		decade. The Boston Gun project demonstrates that the success of any 
		initiative depends largely on its ability to integrate a number of 
		approaches. The analysis concluded that law enforcement and the 
		provision of social opportunities and interventions must work together 
		for interventions to be successful, that interventions must give closer 
		attention to the significance of gang processes, and that those 
		responsible for responding to gangs must use problem-solving models that 
		have proven successful in other settings. In addition, agencies need to 
		be proactive and not overreact and to communicate and share information 
		with each other.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The paper is a

		Correctional Services. The study attempted to determine: (1) whether 
		gangs in South African prisons are as pervasive as in the United States; 
		(2) measures used by the Department of Correctional Services to control 
		gangs' influence; (3) the dynamics that drive South African prison 
		inmates to join gangs; (4) parallels, if any, between the two countries’

		“Prison Gang Development: A Theoretical Model”</a></b> by S. Buentello, 
		et al. <u>The Prison Journal</u>, vol.71, no.2 (3-14), fall/winter 1991.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The analysis uses the 
		inductive method to study the Texas Department of Corrections, using 
		information from staff reports, inmates, inmate records, files on prison 
		gangs, personal observations, and interviews with prison gang members 
		who defected. According to the model, the development of prison gangs 
		involves a 5-stage process. In Stage One, a convicted offender is 
		sentenced to serve time in prison, thereby being separated from the 
		traditional support system and needing to deal with prison guards and 
		other inmates. In Stage Two, the inmate overcomes feelings of isolation, 
		fear, and danger by socializing with certain inmates and becoming part 
		of a clique. While some cliques disband in time due to unit transfer or 
		release of members, others evolve into Stage Three, self-protection 
		groups. As members of a self-protection group gain increased recognition 
		from other inmates, certain members exert stronger influence over other 
		members and contemplate leading the group into Stage Four, a predator 
		group. As members of the predator group enjoy their increased protection 
		and their new-found power over other inmates, they may evolve into Stage 
		Five, a prison gang, which requires involvement in contract murder, drug 
		trafficking, extortion, gambling, and homosexual prostitution. Gang 
		members must wear tattoos, make a lifetime commitment, and function as 
		part of a formal and paramilitary organizational structure. As of 
		December 1990, the Texas Department of Corrections had identified and 
		confirmed 8 prison gangs with a total membership of 1,174.</p>

		“Gangs in New Zealand Prisons”</a></b> by J Meek. <u>Australian and New 
		Zealand Journal of Criminology</u>, vol.25, no.3 (255-277), Dec 1992.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The first official 
		recognition of the gang problem in New Zealand prisons came in 1980, 
		following four serious incidents at separate facilities. Surveys have 
		indicated that more than 20 percent of inmates had present or past gang 
		affiliations. A case study of the Auckland Maximum Security Prison (Paremoremo) 
		demonstrates how gang ascendancy destroyed a unique inmate subculture 
		and forced prison management to operate the facility on a unit basis. 
		Using a 1989 prison census, the author examines the level of gang 
		affiliation and compares gang members and unaffiliated inmates on 
		variables including ethnic origin and age, type of offense, length of 
		sentence, previous convictions, custodial experience, and classification 
		status. Gangs members were likely to be younger, requiring medium- or 
		maximum-security classification, convicted of violent offenses, and 
		serving longer sentences. The New Zealand Department of Justice has 
		tried to defuse tension between members of two rival gangs in prison by 
		appointing mediators from both gangs, responsible for maintaining 
		communications, providing liaison with prison management, resolving 
		disputes between the gangs, and informing new prisoners belonging to 
		either gang of the behavior expected of them.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The more than 3,000 
		letters to and from ABT members from February 1984 through August 1991 
		provide the most extensive description of the origin, development, and 
		activity of ABT. The organization developed in part because of the 
		longstanding racial segregation in the system, the use of inmate guards, 
		and the rapid changes resulting from the judicial decision in Ruiz v. 
		Estelle that resulted in heightened racial tension, the emergence of 
		inmate gangs, and high levels of serious violence. Thus, ABT originated 
		during a period of social change in which many white inmates perceived 
		their status to be declining. Seeking to restore their past status, 
		right-wing inmates developed a moralistic and conspiratorial rhetoric 
		that helped them recruit less racist or extremist inmates but, 
		eventually proved inadequate to sustain the movement in the face of 
		internal controversies and external attack. Membership remained around 
		200 in 1987 and 1988. The intense internal power struggle attracted 
		additional members in 1989, but most of these members failed to remain 
		loyal to the group once released. Thus, like all radically right 
		movements, the ABT declined due to internal disorganization. It will 
		require a sudden increase in strain within the inmate social system to 
		rally its support, and pressure from the Justice Department to integrate 
		individual cells may provide this strain.</p>

		Intelligence Report</u>, issue 108 (8-17), winter 2002. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The author introduces the 
		reader to Leo Felton, who was recruited by members of Aryan Unit One 
		while he was serving time at Northern State Prison in New Jersey. The 
		author explains how Felton was a disturbed teenager who had several 
		arrests for thefts and violent offenses. Felton did not have racist 
		attitudes, however, until he was serving a prison sentence for a drug 
		offense. During this prison term, he met members of Aryan Unit One, who 
		harnessed his anger and violence and directed it toward minority members 
		and Jews. Ironically, unbeknownst to members of the Aryan Unit One, 
		Felton was half Black, having been born to a light-skinned Black 
		civil-rights activist and a white ex-nun. According to the author, 
		Felton played basketball with his father and five Black half-brothers 
		and had Black friends before going to prison for the savage beating of a 
		taxi driver in an apparent road-rage episode. That stint in prison led 
		Felton to become an active member of the racist gang and to plot the 
		eventual destruction of all minorities. The goal, explained Felton in a 
		letter, was to insight a revolution and to establish a “natural order” 
		on the continent. This natural order would mimic Hitler’s. The author 
		tells how Felton met a young woman named Erica Chase, who would 
		eventually move in with Felton in Boston after his release from prison. 
		The two plotted an Aryan terrorist attack before being arrested by 
		police for passing counterfeit bills. Once in prison again, the Boston 
		papers revealed Felton’s racial composition, leading him to attempt 
		suicide. The point of the story of Felton is to illustrate how racist 
		gangs are recruiting members from within prison walls and then sending 
		them out upon release to hatch their violent plots.</p>

		vol.6, no.3 (61-76) spring 1999.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The name &quot;Brotherwoods&quot; 
		is a combination of the names of two established prison gangs: the Aryan 
		Brotherhood, a gang of white racist extremists, and the term 
		&quot;Peckerwood,&quot; which is a racist name for poor whites adopted as a gang 
		name for a number of white racist gangs scattered throughout the United 
		States. The Brotherwoods gang nucleus was established in March 1993 as a 
		small clique of four inmates. The founder had studied and espoused white 
		supremacist doctrines and was a cunning manipulator of other inmates. 
		His ideal candidate for recruitment was young, white, and physically 
		small. Since such inmates were typical prey for other inmates, the 
		Brotherwood leader convinced recruits that strength in numbers was the 
		wisest course they could pursue. The gang did come to represent a potent 
		threat to other inmates as well as to the staff of the correctional 
		facility. The first acts of violence and intimidation by the gang were 
		discovered in January 1995. Activities included plans to attack black 
		drug dealers; the claiming and defending of territory in the prison yard 
		and dining hall; attacks on homosexual inmates; and the establishment of 
		a time frame for plans to instigate a riot, take hostages, and possibly 
		kill correctional officers or staff members. The method of suppressing 
		the Brotherwood gang was simple, legal, and classical. It relied on 
		intelligence about the level of threat posed by the individual members 
		of the gang. Leaders of the gang were identified, separated, and 
		segregated from the main membership base of the gang. The remaining 
		members of the gang were then dispersed throughout the State by 
		transfers to other institutions. Lessons learned from dealing with this 
		gang are outlined.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">he data for the study 
		were collected as part of a larger national survey of gang members who 
		are residing in a variety of institutional settings. The types of 
		facilities that were surveyed in North Carolina included adult and youth 
		facilities under the jurisdiction of the Division of Prisons within the 
		Department of Correction, which ranged in security levels from minimum 
		to maximum security. Twenty-nine facilities in North Carolina were 
		included in the study. A total State sample of 1,706 included 462 (27 
		percent) who reported having joined a gang; 1,160 (68 percent) who 
		reported having never joined a gang; and 84 (5 percent) for which data 
		on this self-report item were missing. The findings reported in this 
		article are based on the responses of the 462 self-proclaimed gang 
		members. The six-part survey instrument consisted primarily of 
		closed-ended questions that tapped the sociodemographic characteristics 
		of the sample, crime-related items, and several items that assessed 
		gang-related issues within and outside the prison setting. Based on the 
		findings, the study concludes that the North Carolina Division of 
		Prisons is in the early phase of gang infiltration. As yet, inmate gangs 
		have not altered the fabric of prison life to a great extent. A little 
		less than half of the gang members reported that they had not been in a 
		fight since they were incarcerated. Thirty-four percent admitted to 
		carrying a weapon, and nearly 30 percent have threatened staff; 25 
		percent of the gang sample have tried to smuggle drugs while 
		incarcerated. The article outlines several areas where continued 
		attention is needed to address the emerging gang problem.</p>

		members, the female auxiliary unit, gang allies and enemies, financial 
		records, and threat rating. The overall threat rating notes that the 
		Latin Kings are a Level Three gang organization; the gang is a 
		centralized, authoritarian, violent formal organization complete with a 
		written constitution and by-laws. In taking advantage of political

		The size of the gang and its penetration of communities outside of its

		“The Changing Face of the Yakuza”</a></b> by Peter Hill. <u>Global Crime</u>, 
		vol.6, no.1 (97-116), Feb 2004.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Over the last half 
		century, Japan has undergone considerable political, economic and social 
		change. In response to these changes, Japan's criminal organisations, 
		collectively known as yakuza, have themselves rapidly adapted. This 
		chapter explores these developments. The two main factors driving the 
		yakuza's historical development are first, changing market opportunities 
		and secondly, vagaries in the legal and law-enforcement environment in 
		which these groups operate. During the last decade these two factors 
		have had a serious impact on the yakuza fortunes; the 1992 b&#333;ryokudan 
		(yakuza) countermeasures law and Japan's protracted economic woes 
		following the collapse of the bubble economy in 1990 have made their 
		lives considerably harder. Since then, legal and social developments 
		have further undermined these groups. While the yakuza have attempted to 
		reduce the impact of these developments by adopting a lower profile and 
		strengthening the mechanisms by which inter-syndicate disputes are 
		resolved peacefully, there is inevitably a tension here with their 
		members' needs to make money. The continued existence of illegal 
		markets, and the lack of political will to seriously tackle these 
		groups, makes the survival of these groups a certainty. However, the 
		space within which they can operate has diminished and is diminishing.</p>

		and there is much less fear of crime among the general public. Japanese 
		police are highly respected; theirs is a job with status and is regarded 
		as a life-long career. While crime rates in Japan are generally lower 
		than in the West, organized crime is a much more serious problem. Yakuza 
		organizations are involved in loan-sharking and drugs, but also have 
		front companies through which they operate legitimate businesses. The

	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">This paper explores 
		developments in the business activities of the yakuza/boryokudan 
		(Japan's organized crime syndicates) following the end of the Showa 
		period in 1989. Since then, the yakuza have had to contend with two 
		events which have had profound effects on their economic environment: 
		the collapse of Japan's bubble economy right at the beginning of the new 
		era, and the introduction of the boryokudan countermeasures law (Botaiho) 
		in 1992. Whilst post-bubble economic stagnation has deprived the yakuza 
		of many lucrative opportunities, it has compensated them with others. 
		The Botaiho, by imposing new restrictions on formerly legal yakuza 
		activities, made these sources of income more costly and thereby 
		similarly forced gang-members to develop new sources of income. In 
		particular, amphetamine dealing and organized theft rings have grown in 
		response to the ‘double punch’ of the bubble and the Botaiho. The paper 
		concludes by suggesting that the continuing economic hardship faced by 
		the yakuza is weakening the intra- and inter-organizational mechanisms 
		by which they have tried to stabilize their world.</p>

		represented by organised crime groups. These groups, in so far as their 
		goal is financial gain, are businesses and are therefore often 
		structurally and operationally able to take full advantage of services 
		provided by other groups or on occasion work with such through an 
		associated or integrated strategy. One of the most lethal organised 
		crime groups in this respect are the Yakuza, or ‘Boryukudan’. The sum 
		total of their criminal activity produces an annual yield of countless 
		millions through various ‘activities’ including money laundering and 
		corporate blackmail. The majority of these activities are carried out by 
		centralised organisations capable of operating through a host of

		management relies on basic Japanese values and encourages offenders to 
		abandon criminality. In contrast to this philosophy, the Yakuza are 
		committed to a criminal subculture, demonstrate loyalty to their gangs, 
		and exhibit a criminal orientation. For this reason, Yakuza inmates are 
		assigned to security prison where they are managed through 
		Japanese-style control methods that promote internal orderliness.</p>

		“Mafias, Triads, Yakuza and Cartels: A Comparative Study of Organized 
		Crime”</a></b> by Andre Bossard. <u>Crime and Justice International</u>, 
		vol.14, no.23 (5-32), Dec 1998.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">he author describes 
		Mafia-type criminal organizations throughout the world, identifying the 
		names, organization, and criminal activities of such enterprises in 
		Europe, Asia, North America, Latin America, and Africa. All of the 
		identified organized crime groups have common characteristics. The most 
		highly structured ones are based on an enterprise-like organization that 
		corresponds to a basic organizational chart that is valid for any sort 
		of business. Organized crime groups can survive only if they manage that 
		chart in such a manner as to ensure strong discipline and absolute 
		secrecy. These groups are obsessed with profit by every means, using 
		terror and corruption to achieve their goals. They conduct not only 
		criminal activities but licit businesses, infiltrating and controlling 
		economic sectors. They attempt to influence and corrupt legitimate 
		economic and political power at all levels, thus posing a threat to 
		democracy by perverting economics and politics for their own ends. The 
		enormous amount of money they obtain from both their illicit and licit 
		activities make them an actual and potential threat not only in 
		individual nations but internationally. Common criminal activities are 
		in three categories: (1) racketeering, extortion, kidnapping, coercive 
		protection, and debt-collecting; (2) illicit service provision, 
		consisting of freely and expensively providing anything usually 
		prohibited, regulated, or taxed by law (drugs, smuggling, gambling, 
		usury, prostitution, pornography, migrants, and manpower); (3) and 
		financial crime, counterfeiting, fraud, and computer crime.</p>

		“From Religious Cult to Criminal Gang: The Evolution of Chinese Triads 
		(Part 1)”</a></b> by Hua-Lun Huang and John Zheng Wang.&nbsp; <u>Journal of 
		Gang Research</u>, vol.9, no.4 (25-32), summer 2002. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">The authors provide a 
		description of the historical development of the Triads in response to 
		past articles which have failed to distinguish between the Triads, 
		Chinese street gangs, and Chinese organized crime groups. The Chinese 
		Triads have been linked to transnational organized crime activities such 
		as human trafficking and drug trafficking. This paper is the first in a 
		three part series. This portion of the series explores the historical 
		foundations of the Triads. The second article will discuss the 
		differences between the Triads, Chinese street gangs, and Chinese 
		organized crime groups. The third will provide the authors’ suggestion 
		for a theoretical framework for understanding the Triads. The various 
		evolutionary phases of the Triads are explored beginning with the 
		development of secret societies based upon Daoism. The religious 
		development of those groups are discussed. The second identified phase 
		of Triad development is the Green Gang period during the late 17th and 
		early 18th centuries. According to the authors, the Green Gang 
		development period begins the transition to an organized criminal 
		enterprise.</p>

		Malevolent Authority”</a></b> by George W. Knox. <u>Journal of Gang 
		Research</u>, vol.6, no.4 (1-39), summer 1999.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">Groups regarded as 
		&quot;cults&quot; have much in common with groups regarded as &quot;gangs&quot; in modern 
		American society. They are similar in that both groups restrict members' 
		exercise of freedom in thought and belief; both demand unquestioning 
		obedience from their members; both have self-appointed authoritarian 
		leaders; and once persons join both types of groups, they tend to 
		undergo certain predictable personality changes. Cults, like gangs, fall 
		in the realm of deviance, and both types of groups encourage members to 
		become situationally dependent on the &quot;group identity.&quot; Both gangs and 
		cults recruit members based on the human need to be accepted and be a 
		part of a group that will affirm personal significance. The primary 
		difference between cults and gangs is that cults have as their axial 
		principle of organization some spiritual/religious/ideological belief 
		system; gangs, on the other hand, are commonly perceived to have no such 
		well-developed belief system. Further, gangs are more sinister in terms 
		of the use of violence against their own members and those outside the 
		gang. Disobedience in a cult occasions much less severe discipline, and 
		violence against non-cult members is not common behavior for cult 
		members.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in">Only a small aspect of 
		the study examined the issue of Satanic/Occult dabbling. The survey, 
		which was conducted by the National Gang Crime Research Center, 
		contained three questions that measured some aspect of Satanic cult 
		practices. One question asked whether the respondent had &quot;ever 
		participated in any Satanic worship ceremonies&quot;; the second question 
		asked if the respondent had ever &quot;dabbled in black magic or the occult&quot;; 
		and the third question asked if the respondent had &quot;ever participated in 
		a cone of power Satanic ceremony.&quot; Six percent (n=110) of the 
		respondents reported that they had participated in a Satanic worship 
		service. Only 10.1 percent reported having dabbled in black magic or the 
		occult; only 2.9 percent reported that they had ever participated in a 
		real Satanic cult ceremony. The survey found that Devil worshippers and 
		dabblers in the occult were more likely to be involved in gangs, as were 
		dabblers in black magic. Two-thirds of those involved in the more 
		serious side of Devil worship and the occult have joined a gang. The 
		Satanic/Occult dabbler had higher incestuous sexual relationships, a 
		higher likelihood of forcing someone else to have sex with them, and 
		higher likelihood of being a victim of forcible sex. Involvement in 
		methamphetamine use and sales, as well as fighting and weapons carrying 
		while in custody were also factors significantly associated with 
		Satanic/Occult dabblers.</p>
