  <blockquote>
    <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Introduction</font></b></p>
    <p>&quot;White Supremacist groups emerged early-on in the history of United
    States. They usually operated clandestinely, in an attempt to avoid the
    attention of law enforcement and the media. Historically, these groups
    relied primarily on word-of-mouth notoriety to intimidate their intended
    targets. Their numbers were sporadic until recently. Now there is
    unprecedented growth in the number of and membership in, white supremacist
    groups.</p>
    Only about 25,000 Americans are hardcore ideological activists for the white
    supremacist movement, a tiny fraction of the white population. They are
    organized into approximately 300 different organizations. No two groups are
    exactly alike. They ranging from seemingly innocuous religious sects or tax
    protesters to openly militant, even violent, neo-Nazi skinheads and Ku Klux
    Klan Klaverns. The basic underpinnings of these organizations is they are
    rooted in religion, which is combined with a paramilitary, survivalists, or
    anarchists operational approach. Currently, Klan groups are on the decline
    while more Hitler-inspired groups, like the National Alliance and the Church
    of the Creator, are growing in numbers and influence. Swastikas and Uzis are
    replacing hoods and crosses.
    <p>Some 150,000 to 200,000 people subscribe to racist publications, attend
    their marches and rallies, and donate money. Approximately 100 hatelines are
    in operation, with recorded messages that propagandize the caller with
    hate-motivated speeches and publicize upcoming meetings and rallies. Because
    of their increasingly sophisticated use of the media and electronic
    technology, there are 150 independent racist radio and television shows that
    air weekly and reach hundreds of thousands of sympathizers.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s, the Ku Klux Klan was the most infamous hate groups with an
    estimated 40,000 members in 1965. But by the end of the 1970s, the majority
    of white supremacists belonged to organizations other than the Klan. They
    had evolved from loosely structured fraternal organizations into highly
    developed paramilitary groups with extensive survivalist training camps
    often funded by proceeds from counterfeit money and bank and armored car
    robberies. In the 1990s, they have transformed themselves from a violent
    vanguard into a sophisticated political movement with a significant
    constituency.</p>
    <p>The Aryan Nations in Idaho has been one of the umbrella organizations
    seeking to unite various Klan and neo-Nazi groups.</p>
    <p>In 1979, founder Richard Butler convened the first Aryan Nations World
    Congress on his property and attracted Klan and neo-Nazi leaders from the
    US, Canada and Europe, who gathered to exchange ideas and strategies.</p>
    <p>There are at least 26 different Ku Klux Klan groups in the United States.
    The largest and fastest-growing is the Knights of the KKK, headquartered in
    Harrison, Arkansas under the leadership of Thom Robb. The Knights recently
    held rallies in Wisconsin, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Texas, Tennessee,
    Arkansas and Mississippi. Robb's Knights were the first group to recruit
    Skinheads into their ranks and he has been quick to put promising young
    leaders like Shawn Slater in Colorado into the national spotlight. It is the
    most Nazi-esque of the Klans, maintaining strong ties to Richard Butler's
    Aryan Nations in Idaho.</p>
    <p>Robb's group, originally founded by David Duke in the 1970s, has moved
    into national Klan leadership because of the dissolution of the Invisible
    Empire Knights of the KKK in 1993.</p>
    <p>The Holocaust-denial movement is the clearest expression of the
    anti-Semitic nature of white supremacy. Various institutions within the
    white supremacist movement are revising the history of Nazi Germany,
    claiming that the Holocaust against the Jews either did not happen or was
    greatly exaggerated.</p>
    <p>The most sophisticated of these institutions is the Institute for
    Historical Review (IHR) in California. Founded by longtime racist and
    anti-Semite Willis Carto, the IHR offers hatred with an intellectual gloss.</p>
    <p>Many of the distinctions between various Klan and neo-Nazi groups have
    dissolved. The membership is extremely fluid; members flow in and out
    because of internal squabbles and leadership battles. Cross-memberships,
    in-depth leadership summit meetings, and the use of common periodicals are
    frequent, indicating considerable organizational cohesion.</p>
    <p>Here are just a few groups that are active: Church Of The Creator; 14
    Word Press; Aryan Nations (Church Of Jesus Christ Christian); Mountain
    Church; The Identity Church Movement; Aryan Preservation Society; Carolinian
    Lords of The Caucasus; Knights Of The Ku Klux Klan; Posse Comitatus
    (&quot;power of the county); Volksfront; The Covenant Sword, Arm Of The
    Lord; Christian Patriots Defense League; Skinheads; The Order; National
    Association For The Advancement Of White People; White Aryan Resistance
    (WAR); Christian National Socialist; Neo Supreme White Power.</p>
    <p>These groups will not hesitate to use bombs, murder, arson, and assault
    to accomplish their goals and objectives.</p>
    <b>
    <p><font color="#0000FF">Philosophy</font></p>
    </b>
    <p>White Supremacy is an ideology that believes the United States government
    is controlled by a conspiratorial cabal of non-whites or Jews or a
    combination of both. They advocate changing this &quot;Zionist Occupation
    Government (ZOG)&quot; through terror or violence, but also are becoming
    more politically active in order to influence the mainstream politics. They
    tell their followers that crime and welfare abuse by African Americans,
    immigration by Mexicans and Asians, or a fictional Jewish conspiracy are
    responsible for a decline in the status of white people. They accuse civil
    rights organizations of &quot;hating white people&quot; and brand whites who
    do not support them as race traitors or self-haters.</p>
    <p>Although the Ku Klux Klan is the most notorious, hate groups come in many
    forms. For example, they organize as religious cults, most predominantly the
    Christian Identity model which asserts that (1) white people are the
    original Lost Tribes of Israel; (2) Jews are descendants of Satan; and (3)
    African Americans and other people of color are pre-Adamic, or beasts
    created by God before He created Adam, the first white man. Christian
    Identity followers feel they can attack and murder Jews and people of color
    without contradicting their religious convictions because they have been
    told by their leaders that people of color and Jews have no souls.</p>
    <p>Another significant religious cult is the Church of the Creator, founded
    in 1973. Its members believe they are engaged in a racial holy war (RAHOWA)
    between the &quot;pure&quot; Aryan race and the &quot;mud races.&quot;
    Adherents are frequently in the headlines for their violence. In 1993,
    members were arrested by the FBI as part of the Fourth Reich Skinheads who
    attempted to bomb a church in Los Angeles and assassinate LA’s Rodney
    King. Members have also been arrested in numerous murders, violent assaults,
    and bank robberies across the nation. They believe that they can precipitate
    the race war by provoking a violent response with attacks upon Jews and
    people of color.</p>
    <p>Most white supremacists in America believe that the United States is a
    &quot;Christian&quot; nation, with a special relationship between religion
    and the rule of law. Because racists give themselves divine permission from
    God to hate, they often don't see that their actions are driven by hate;
    they claim to &quot;just love God and the white race.&quot; If they are
    religious, they distort Biblical passages to justify their bigotry.</p>
    <p>Each group is working to create a society totally dominated by whites by
    excluding and denying the rights of non-whites and Jews. The movement's
    links are global.</p>

    <p><font color="#0000FF">Enemies / Rivals and Allies</font></p>
    </b>
    <p>These groups and their members have similar profiles. They have strong
    feelings of white ethnicity and are often members of the biker subculture.
    These groups tend to be allies of each other, and their enemies are
    generally non-whites, members of the Jewish faith, the government, and
    authority figures.</p>
    <b>
    <p><font color="#0000FF">Propensity for Disruptive Behavior</font></p>
    </b>
    <p>White Supremacy groups pose a potentially dangerous dilemma. Their hate
    orientation and racial rhetoric combined with deep religious beliefs can
    cause serious disruption/violence anywhere, as they seek to promote their
    divisive dogma within our vulnerable multi-cultural, multi-ethnic,
    multi-racial environment.</p>
    <p>The Corrections arena must be acutely are of the potential these groups
    have of coming together and exploding into a major disturbance—especially
    in these times of increased inmate numbers and longer sentences served.</p>
    <p>In 1983 Posse Comitatus member murdered two federal marshals in North
    Dakota.</p>
    <p>The Order commits a 1983 bank robbery in Seattle, WA.</p>
    <p>In 1983 and 1984, The Order, a far right revolutionary organization,
    committed a series of violent crimes—murder, bombings, and armed robbery.</p>
    <p>In 1986 ten members of The Order were convicted for various crimes
    including killings and bombings.</p>
    <p>In 1986 FBI probe found a Church Of The Identity group stockpiling
    weapons and plotting to finance a paramilitary base by robbing an armored
    car in Nevada.</p>
    <p>The most violent wing of the white supremacist movement is the growing
    neo-Nazi skinhead movement, of which there are about 3,500 members in the
    United States. They openly worship Hitler and many young people, with ages
    from 13 to 25, are inducted into their ranks after committing a hate crime
    as part of the gang initiation. Their youthful appearance is rapidly
    changing the face of hate. Girls are rapidly rising into skinhead
    leadership. Not all skinheads are Nazis, and a movement of skinheads in
    opposition to the Nazi model has asserted itself in recent years.</p>
    <p>Skinhead groups have developed their own leadership and appeal, distinct
    from adult Klan and neo-Nazi groups. Skinheads have committed over 25
    murders in the last four years and have expanded into 40 states.</p>
    <p>Skinheads are the &quot;urban guerrillas&quot; of the hate movement. More
    seasoned adults have abandoned open violence to sanitize their public
    images. Such adults recruit and encourage young people to commit criminal
    activities, just as older drug dealers use young kids to push drugs.
    Unfortunately, this means that hate crimes committed by juveniles are often
    seen as mere pranks, not the serious assaults on liberty and freedom that
    they really are. This tactic also frequently allows the adult leaders to
    escape punishment. For example, the FBI learned of the assassination plots
    planned by the Fourth Reich Skinheads by monitoring the phone lines of Tom
    Metzger, leader of White Aryan Resistance in California.</p>
    <p>Skinheads have firmly established themselves in six to eight national
    organizations, rather than simply as appendages of adult groups.</p>
    <p>All of these groups and their members are fanatical in their racist
    beliefs. Fanaticism combined with religious beliefs poured over violence and
    explosives produces a very dangerous product—use extreme caution.&quot;</p>
