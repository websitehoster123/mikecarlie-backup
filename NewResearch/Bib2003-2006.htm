		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">This unique volume 
		offers first-hand accounts of women's experience with crime and 
		victimization and provides a rare opportunity for students to view the

		to offer a surrogate experience--an inside view on how female

		law breaking is a rational choice in others.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">

		The paper examines these themes in relation to current academic

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">For a decade, the

		American-born criminals back to their homelands -- without warning local

		transnational gangs that now threaten the stability of the region's

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">Not unlike mainstream 
		society of the United States, Indian Country faces new challenges 
		regarding the values, mores, and behavior of its young people. Since 
		their first encounters with European explorers, American Indians have 
		fought to preserve their culture and traditions. Federal policies that 
		addressed the &quot;Indian problem&quot; by establishing reservations and BIA 
		boarding schools, as well as through the implementation of assimilation, 
		termination, and relocation programs, are but a few illustrations of a 
		long history of institutional efforts to colonize American Indian

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">Gang membership is 
		repeatedly reported to be one of the strongest predictors of antisocial

		selection effect or whether it primarily is related to a facilitation of 
		antisocial behaviour within the gang has scarcely been an object of 
		empirical study. This paper examines how antisocial behaviour and gang 
		membership are associated among adolescents across time, using 
		longitudinal data from a representative sample of Norwegian adolescents</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">There are also 
		reports that street gangs are involved in serious and violent offending

		States. However, there is little criminological research on gangs in the 
		United Kingdom that can shed light on this development.</span></p>

		the dynamics of conflict between two youth scenes in the Norwegian city

		‘neo-Nazis’ regularly committed acts of violence against other youths

		<span style="font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">This study details a 
		network analysis of the street gang landscape in Newark, New Jersey. 
		Using individual gang members as the unit of analysis and multiple 
		layers of associations as the linkages within the networks, the results 
		suggest that the gangs in Newark are loosely organized with pockets of 
		cohesion. In addition, there is variation with regard to individual 
		connectedness within the gangs, and certain gang members emerge as 
		&quot;cut-points&quot; or the only connection among gang members or groups of gang 
		members.</span></p>
